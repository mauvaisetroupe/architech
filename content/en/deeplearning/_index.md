## Notes from Coursera Specializations

In this section of the website, you'll find my detailed notes and insights from the Coursera specializations I completed: [Machine Learning](./machine-learning-specialization/) and [Deep Learning](./deep-learning-specialization/). 

These specializations have been instrumental in expanding my knowledge and understanding of these exciting fields.

### Machine Learning Specialization

The Machine Learning Specialization, also offered on Coursera, is a comprehensive program that explores the foundations and algorithms behind machine learning. Throughout this specialization, I gained a deep understanding of various machine learning algorithms, their theoretical underpinnings, and their practical applications.

My notes from the Machine Learning Specialization cover topics such as:

- Supervised learning algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, etc.)
- Unsupervised learning algorithms (clustering, dimensionality reduction, etc.)
- Recommender systems
- Deep learning and neural networks
- Advice for applying machine learning techniques in practice

### Deep Learning Specialization

The Deep Learning Specialization offered on Coursera is a comprehensive program designed to provide a deep understanding of deep learning algorithms, architectures, and applications. Throughout the specialization, I gained practical hands-on experience through assignments and projects, allowing me to develop a strong foundation in this rapidly evolving domain.

My notes from the Deep Learning Specialization cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Neural networks and deep learning
- Convolutional neural networks
- Recurrent neural networks
- Structuring machine learning projects
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sequence models
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
- Special applications of deep learning
