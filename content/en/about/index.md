On ArchiTech.lu, in addition to other content, you will find my notes specifically from the two Coursera specializations I completed: [Machine Learning](../deeplearning/machine-learning-specialization/) and [Deep Learning](../deeplearning/deep-learning-specialization/).

ArchiTech.lu hosts the documentation for [EADesignIT](../ea-design-it/), an Application Dependency Mapping Tool that I developed as a side project.

EADesignIT simplifies application management and facilitates the description of functional flows between applications through Excel file imports. It automatically generates diagrams in PlantUML or Draw.io.
