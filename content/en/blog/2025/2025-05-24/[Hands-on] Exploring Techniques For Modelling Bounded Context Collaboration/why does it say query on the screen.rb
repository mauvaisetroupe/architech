why does it say query on the screen
sticky in the event storming
picture uh basically this context here
is sending a query to this context here
oh but it looks green so it should be a
read model
so yeah that's uh so i
i did this this is how i would do this
but yeah that's the thing with event
storming i guess right nick
what i've said in the past it's the
concept that matters it's not
the name of the sticky it's more like
the
what does it represent and if query
helps
in this case but the problem is we build
habits we we associate things like
oranges and events
green is a read model and so yeah but i
mean the name on
the name you give that concept so
right the event is usually event but in
this case you call
the the the the pink one context
while uh in in other you can call it
external systems in software design
we call it system in process design and
in in your version you call it contact
so you adjust the naming
according to the to what you're doing i
think that's powerful
that's the powerful stuff about event
storming you can
leave outcome you can leave out concepts
or you can rename concepts what works
for you in a specific
workshop yeah and i i would say
event storming is more flexible in that
respect
yeah but it just means you have to
re-learn some
some the notation each time what things
mean which can be confusing
yeah whereas uml the uml sequence
diagrams are very clear
but it's less flexible i would say
because did you make it green because it
has something to do with the read model
or is just a coincidence it's just the
query elements
it happens to be green yeah i use green
for query and other things so and there
aren't that many colors to choose from
in Miro
yeah so the the yeah the read model is
kind of the
source of the query in a respect so
there is
some relationship there ah i also call
it
i also call it information okay
so it's either query read model
information for me it's the same concept
it's
information yeah
but in this in this diagram here where i
put query
is it is context a querying the read
model of the next context
or is the first context on the left
updating its read model
which the second context is querying
it's not clear because there
there isn't a standard notation we've
been taught in school and we've learned
it forever
like we're making stuff up as we go
along a bit here yeah
which is useful and i think this goes
this goes deeper into the concept of shu
hari the the model for learning
like you start as a beginner you kind of
copy what's there
and then you progress into competent
level
and then you become a master and you
stop following the rules and you
you start applying ad hoc
yeah i'm like a master in a situation
and i would say that's
that's what's good about event storming
it is flexible
that you can adapt it to the problem
you're facing
it it just takes a long time to get to
that stage sometimes
and if if you've got people who are in
the shoe level
and they're still trying to work out
what is event storming and what does a
green thing mean
and they see someone else who's a master
of using it for something else
yeah it can be confusing and confusing
so so i think that's so
fair yeah so i think alberto's last
point is to always abide by the color
coding so there would be a blue in
between
officially but i always say the same
that you say nick
if you think it will be too explicit and
it will be common sense then you just
leave concepts out during
one of these storms and that's what you
did here
yeah it's like oh people if i go to
france i have to drive on the other side
of the road
but i'm so used to driving on the left
side of the road
even though i know i'm supposed to drive
on the right-hand side i've been driving
on the left-hand side for almost 20
years
like it's just a habit there so if i've
been doing event storming for a year
and i've been associating green with one
thing and now it means something else
even if you tell me
like my brain is still like trained to
see it as something else
so it's it's hard to break the
association and the habits
