1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,439
and we're live good evening everyone and

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,680
welcome to another virtual dvd

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,639
uh this time with me is uh nick and

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,559
we're gonna do some and a lot of other

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,280
people

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,799
where we're gonna do some techniques for

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,440
modeling bounded contacts into

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,240
creation so nick we've been doing some

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,279
check-ins right with

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,000
with the whole group and uh what are we

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,160
gonna do now

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,359
so to kick things off i thought it would

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,880
be good to explain

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,640
you know why why this topic why today

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
and what what's inside this meetup what

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
we're going to be doing over the next

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,600
hour maybe stretching to two hours so

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,120
it's about strategic design it's about

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
architecture and very often when we

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,960
think about architecture

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,640
and strategic design we think about

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
bounded contexts

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,800
and we think about boundaries like if

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,760
you want to

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
architect a system you have to take a

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,120
large

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,480
a large system and you break it down

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,640
into subsystems some people call them

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
micro services some people call them

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,680
bounded contexts

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,439
some people say a microservice is a

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,720
bounded context

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,240
i'm sure we have some strong opinions

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,159
about that i know there's a few blog

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,840
posts out there

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,159
one recently from alberto brandolini

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,080
touching on that topic

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,280
but what people don't talk about as much

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,960
is the integration

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,640
of those subsystems of your

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,200
microservices or bounded contexts

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,320
certainly not in the design phase so

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,280
people talk about

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,840
event-driven event-driven architecture

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,479
from a technical perspective but

46
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,680
not so much as a design activity

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,399
and if you want to design a loosely

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,880
coupled architecture

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,320
which we all strive to do it's no

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,000
there aren't many things we agree on as

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,439
an industry but

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,360
building loosely coupled systems is one

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,600
of those things that we all strive for

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,920
because we know that a loosely coupled

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
system means that we can make changes

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
easily to one part

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,520
without affecting other parts of the

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,720
system that gives teams autonomy

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
and in order to to design that loose

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,800
coupling it's not just about

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
finding the right boundaries it's about

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,239
identifying how those different

63
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,720
subsystems communicate with each other

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,760
and and making the specific choices

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
so we we broadly speaking we have

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
three kinds of message and i use the

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
word message generically

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840
not to me the message bus we have

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
commands we have queries and we have

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
events

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,640
and then for each of those kinds of

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,879
messages you have to decide what what's

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,440
the payload inside that message

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,840
and so there are a lot of choices here

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,599
the type of message what's contained in

76
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,280
the message how you name the message how

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,040
big is the message

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
and all of those things can have a big

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,120
impact on coupling

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
for example if you use a command

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,239
basically it's one context telling

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,360
another context

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,319
i want you to do something so the

84
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,640
responsibility of deciding what happens

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,440
next

86
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,840
is in the sender but if you use an event

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
you're saying hey something's happened

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,239
and it's up to someone else another

89
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,879
context to listen to that

90
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,280
and decide i'm going to decide what to

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,080
do

92
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
so broadly speaking that's that's

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,959
that's kind of stepping on the

94
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,280
the area of orchestration which is

95
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,959
centralized coordination versus

96
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,680
choreography

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
and so yeah how you integrate things

98
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,879
has a big impact on coupling

99
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,480
and how do you design the integration

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,400
it's not something i see a lot of that

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,480
it's like i was saying previously people

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,319
talk a lot about boundaries but not so

103
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,200
much about the integration

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,959
so there are a bunch of tools out there

105
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,239
but none of them have really become

106
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,319
standard tools i would say there's lots

107
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,799
of discussion

108
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,160
there was lots so there was lots of

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
discussion on one of the github tickets

110
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,280
so we we have a simple technique called

111
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,639
message flow modeling which you'll see

112
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,000
later

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,040
and on on the github

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
on the github project for that technique

115
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,280
it was a long conversation about how

116
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,639
should you display

117
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,320
commands and events flowing through

118
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,919
different contexts

119
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,400
there were quite a few opinions on there

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,919
and actually that's how we came to have

121
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,680
this meet up to review the different

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,040
techniques

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,080
and to evaluate the trade-offs

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,360
and to to maybe start thinking about

125
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,880
giving advice in the future so shaping

126
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,400
best practices

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
when you're designing a system and

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
you're in situation x yeah this

129
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,639
technique

130
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,520
why might be most suitable like event

131
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,240
storming

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,680
for your boundaries showing

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,600
communication between a boundary context

134
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
when would you use that

135
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,560
and when might you not use that

136
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,759
so that's the background to this

137
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,600
one other thing i wanted to mention is

138
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,320
that in the meetup description itself

139
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,759
we talked about vladik kononov one of

140
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,000
his comments which he talks a lot about

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,120
which is

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,240
global complexity versus

143
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,639
local complexity so if you're not

144
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,639
familiar with these concepts

145
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,800
you probably know what they are but you

146
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
might not know how to name them and the

147
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,120
naming

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
is is really useful it gives you a way

149
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
to express these concepts very easily in

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
conversation

151
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,600
so local complexity is when

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
something in and of itself is very

153
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,800
simple

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,840
so if you have a microservice and it's

155
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
100 lines of code

156
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
that microservice is very simple because

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,919
there's not much code theoretically

158
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,520
you can do a lot of damage in 100 lines

159
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,160
of code but typically speaking if

160
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,919
you've got a microservice 100 lines of

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,199
code versus a microservice 10 000 lines

162
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,000
of code

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
the one with the 100 lines of code is

164
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
smaller and is likely to have

165
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,400
much less local complexity

166
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,919
and the problem here is if you have

167
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,639
small micro services you have more micro

168
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,759
services

169
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,479
and so you have more complexity in how

170
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,280
those systems

171
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
talk to each other the messages flowing

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,800
between them because now you've got

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
network boundaries

174
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,440
you've got public contracts so if things

175
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,680
live inside the same code base

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,199
you can change everything atomically

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,800
when you have two separate code bases

178
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,639
which are deployed separately

179
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,120
a change to the interface of one would

180
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
break the other one so you start getting

181
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,639
into backwards compatibility

182
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
versioning etc

183
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,960
so uh the name here is local versus

184
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,319
global complexity

185
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,400
and with with the message flow modeling

186
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,199
or the bounded context integration we're

187
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,520
looking for the global complexity

188
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,960
what's all the stuff that lives in

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
between bounded contexts

190
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,520
and the complexity there not necessarily

191
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,199
the infrastructure itself but

192
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
the communication patterns

193
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,639
so what we're going to do this evening

194
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,080
is for the first part

195
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
is we're going to review some existing

196
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,840
techniques i will reveal

197
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,360
a section on the mirror board very

198
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,120
shortly

199
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,560
and then after that we'll have a bit of

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,479
a discussion and then we'll do some

201
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,000
hands-on modeling later in groups

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
so before i get started i've just spoken

203
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
for eight minutes which felt like an

204
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
hour

205
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,759
does anyone else want to add any

206
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,919
thoughts on what i talked about

207
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,160
you know maybe maybe you've had this

208
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,840
problem where people have focused on

209
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
boundaries and not the integrations and

210
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,039
it's been problematic

211
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,440
or maybe you've worked in a team who are

212
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,800
very focused on

213
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
the messaging aspects between bounded

214
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
context or microservices

215
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,879
and you've got some advice here about

216
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
things that work well or

217
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,639
maybe the concepts of local versus

218
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,639
global complexity

219
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,039
resonate with you or maybe you think

220
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,879
it's it's the model's too simple and

221
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,479
there's more

222
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,280
local local and global aren't sufficient

223
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,680
alone

224
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
and uh if you do want to speak up you

225
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,639
can just start speaking well if anyone

226
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,319
clashes we'll manage that as we go along

227
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:30,960
it's just

228
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,200
it's normal for meetups online don't

229
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,120
worry about that

230
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,919
there is a question in the chat i can

231
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,039
read it out

232
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,279
cool so anthony davis saying i'm not

233
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,039
sure if it's relevant but one technique

234
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,720
i came across recently was event

235
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,360
modeling

236
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,640
is that something you've explored

237
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,080
so we we do have event modeling on

238
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
tonight's list of activities

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
so yes it is relevant it is a good

240
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
suggestion

241
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
and it is something that's in this space

242
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:09,839
for sure

243
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,800
what's your favorite technique kenny no

244
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
i was just

245
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,080
so so my favorite technique is still

246
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,360
event storming

247
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,959
okay i've tried

248
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
the others as well uh

249
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,839
domain storytelling for instance or the

250
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,360
the version you use of

251
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
naturally but one thing that kept in

252
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,880
mind when you say the

253
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,800
what you just said about local versus um

254
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
right between the microservices

255
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,160
complexity

256
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,920
and um what people sometimes try to do

257
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,519
is mimic communication because it's

258
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,360
communication right and

259
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,399
thinking that you can run 100

260
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,519
microservices while your communication

261
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,120
between the teams

262
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,399
is almost non-existent

263
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,080
yeah be careful with that

264
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,000
fix your communication problems and we

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
were just

266
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,000
the twittering with root if you if

267
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,519
you're if you're not following root

268
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,240
milan yet

269
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,399
please do she has a lot of great

270
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,360
insights on this

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,519
doing so there was actually this paper

272
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,720
where we this

273
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,880
was she recently posted about conway's

274
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,519
law alignment in 1999

275
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,240
about this topic and it's really

276
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,040
interesting that

277
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,279
it it keeps coming back right and and we

278
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,040
we just made a joke russell

279
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
root's law is everything you try to

280
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
learn or want to learn

281
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,040
she probably has already written about

282
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,640
css and

283
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,920
um what i'm trying to get is she had

284
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,200
this great heuristic that

285
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,399
uh i now call it the 3c heuristic which

286
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,920
means communication communication

287
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,959
communication

288
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,360
so if you cannot do communication right

289
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
between teams or between people

290
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,440
please don't go for local

291
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,920
less local complexity but go for for

292
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
more of a monolith architecture because

293
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
that will probably fit your

294
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,800
company better yeah i actually have a

295
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
name for that anti-pattern

296
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
i call it organizational dysfunctions

297
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,519
mirrored as architectural complexity

298
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,160
like basically you you've got these

299
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
problems in your organization

300
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,000
and rather than fixing how teams

301
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,360
collaborate you try and solve the

302
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,800
problem in code

303
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
so one of them one of the examples i

304
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,880
have here

305
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,399
kenny yeah yeah no i was just trying to

306
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,200
pitch in there

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,240
where you say i recently uh someone gave

308
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,360
me a metaphor

309
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,680
and it's outside the itt but they were

310
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,640
saying like uh

311
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,800
going towards a micro services pro

312
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,399
microsoft architecture while

313
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,360
jape and dave is constantly talking

314
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,000
about

315
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,959
look for what's wrong now don't think

316
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,800
about something new that's

317
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,519
fun it's like having a relationship and

318
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,720
thinking that marriage

319
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
or a child will help your relationship

320
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,680
at the moment

321
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,480
that's the same for thinking yeah

322
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
thinking that your organization will do

323
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,720
better

324
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
if you just think oh microservices

325
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,279
everyone's doing that and it sounds fun

326
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,160
no fun fun things won't help you there

327
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
neither does that holiday it's

328
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,560
sit down talk to each other see what's

329
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,600
going wrong now

330
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,720
and start from there new heuristic

331
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,560
you can only have a microservice if

332
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
you've got a child

333
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,320
like no the number of microservices you

334
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,839
can have is the number of children you

335
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,710
have

336
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,279
[Music]

337
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
yeah so that i was i was thinking about

338
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,440
that metaphor right so

339
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,760
don't don't don't look at that don't

340
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,399
don't look at

341
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,040
don't look at the feature what you want

342
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,680
and what's

343
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,279
fun same with when your team is

344
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,560
not fun thinking that you go to a fun

345
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,519
day with your group no sit down talk to

346
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,320
each other and

347
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,399
go into the conflict or like uh right

348
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,519
someone is sitting in the fire safas

349
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,760
was sitting in the fire sit in the fire

350
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,639
with your team

351
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,480
and battle the conflict so there's one

352
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,880
more

353
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,440
question in the chat uh is asking

354
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,240
whether

355
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,920
context mapping helps with global

356
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,279
complexity and establishing

357
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,639
communication patterns

358
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,760
with bandwidth context

359
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,120
i can answer that one if you like so

360
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,880
my opinion is that context mapping does

361
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,760
help

362
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
although i've got some caveats about

363
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,160
context mapping which is

364
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,440
most of us don't know how to do it

365
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,079
properly and

366
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,240
here's an exclusive scoop for you if you

367
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
want to learn how to view context

368
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,639
mapping

369
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,600
go to eric evans dvd workshop and he

370
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,680
teaches context mapping

371
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,800
via a play like

372
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,160
you will play a role in some fictitious

373
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,199
company

374
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,959
and you will learn context mapping by

375
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,399
actually doing

376
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,279
amateur drama in his workshop so i've

377
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,639
been told i haven't been to it it's on

378
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,920
my wish i've

379
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,399
i've been there it was great uh three

380
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,279
years ago it

381
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,680
yeah three years ago explored who did it

382
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,839
was nice

383
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,079
i can't remember i was just so much it

384
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,519
was so much fun i i

385
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,199
i still probably have to play lying

386
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,160
around here i need to look it up

387
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,360
but yes going back to context mapping um

388
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,120
there are a number of patterns in there

389
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,880
which do which do

390
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,600
vis which do surface global complexity

391
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,560
one of those

392
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,079
is the conformist pattern

393
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,959
and being aware of where you're using

394
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,800
the conform is can be very useful for a

395
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,079
couple of reasons

396
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,839
so a conformist is i'm going to use the

397
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,440
domain model from another system i

398
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,480
integrate with

399
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,240
because the cost of translating is too

400
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,079
high so

401
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,839
i used to work for a company that built

402
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,320
marketing automation software

403
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,480
and they were using a facebook marketing

404
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,079
api and basically

405
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,600
in our code base we used the facebook

406
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,000
model

407
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,040
exactly in our code and then

408
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,160
facebook started changing their api and

409
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,959
our code

410
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,680
was coupled to their model so our code

411
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,360
basically

412
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,040
had to keep trying to keep up with

413
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
facebook's api

414
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
but the code was basically a mixture of

415
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,800
facebook api versions one two three plus

416
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,839
some custom bits so with context mapping

417
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,120
you can see what you've got patterns

418
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,720
like the conformist

419
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
and you can see where you've got chains

420
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,160
so this can

421
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
this context conforms to this one and

422
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
then

423
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,720
another context conforms to that one so

424
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,320
if the first one changes like you've got

425
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,560
a whole chain of contexts

426
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,120
which could all potentially be coupled

427
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
to each other's contracts and have to

428
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,000
change together

429
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,320
so yeah it's cool it's called the

430
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,920
deadlock conformist pattern

431
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
i've seen it a lot of times in big

432
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,120
enterprises like a chain of conformists

433
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,880
yeah so i didn't know the name for it

434
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,480
but uh mikhail plot

435
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,759
he's got some talks on this topic um

436
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,480
and he does name some of the patterns so

437
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,160
just to break up a second

438
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,519
break this conversation i've unlocked

439
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,880
the the main section of the miro board

440
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,279
and we've got a collection of modeling

441
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,920
techniques which you can see

442
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
next to each technique you can leave

443
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,680
some feedback so thumbs up you like it

444
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,639
thumbs down you don't like something

445
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,360
about it

446
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,959
so it's not the technique itself it's

447
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,639
something about the technique

448
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,800
so for the first one uml you could say

449
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,959
thumbs up i like the way it works

450
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,320
vertically

451
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,279
okay and if you if you've got comments

452
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,959
or you're not sure the third column is

453
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,839
kind of

454
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,279
there i'm thinking about this i'm not

455
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,120
sure about this

456
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,720
so have a look at all of those

457
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,639
techniques leave as much feedback as you

458
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,079
want to

459
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,079
and we'll have a discussion in about

460
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,120
i'll set a timer for like 20 minutes

461
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,920
but we can also whilst you're doing that

462
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,600
we can still carry on this discussion

463
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,000
here

464
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,959
yeah someone uh

465
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,600
i think uh yeah nick maybe you can lock

466
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,559
the

467
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,000
the frame and the background so that

468
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,679
people don't move it around all right

469
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,600
yeah sorry about that okay i'll lock it

470
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,439
how it is now

471
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,439
i think somebody copied it over

472
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,480
basically instead of

473
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
all right let's lock what we've got

474
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,440
there now should be okay

475
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,000
so if anyone uh does this youtube stream

476
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
is live right so is anyone watching

477
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
uh there i'm monitoring the youtube chat

478
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,799
so if you if you have any comments or

479
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,360
like i said strong opinions for nick

480
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,720
uh let us know in the youtube chat

481
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,120
yeah well uh all right i'm gonna pass it

482
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,840
or say

483
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,360
i'm gonna quickly put this board in

484
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,280
read-only mode just for a minute and

485
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,760
then i'll

486
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,679
uh i'll tidy this

487
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,840
section up i'll lock some stuff

488
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,320
okay

489
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,000
nobody's moving anymore yeah they're all

490
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
frozen that

491
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
that's uh that's interesting okay

492
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,039
so the board is locked and what i should

493
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,640
have explained is

494
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,240
all you need to use here is the post-its

495
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,280
sticky note button over here select to

496
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,000
post it

497
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,919
and try and keep the same size medium

498
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,880
just like that so i'll unlock it now and

499
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,160
we can try again

500
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,960
does that work yes it does like everyone

501
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,760
moves again

502
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,240
that's nice

503
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,240
so what sorry you're saying something

504
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,559
kenny

505
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,280
no i i don't know i i was saying to

506
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,559
people on youtube if

507
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:11,840
they want to ask questions let us know

508
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,240
it will be interesting to see if anyone

509
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,960
here

510
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,520
is from the bpmn world has got

511
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,840
experience with the bpmn choreography

512
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,160
and collaboration i'm very open to bpmn

513
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
i haven't used it

514
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,039
really and i don't know if it's a good

515
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:31,600
tool for

516
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,679
collaboration i have my reservations

517
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,919
there

518
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,799
yeah i also have my bias there just

519
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,160
because i saw

520
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,600
enterprises uh go haywire with bp bbns

521
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:45,919
can

522
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,799
be very well i think but you still need

523
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,679
to have

524
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,120
it mostly think about kaplan

525
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
that's what i always think yeah i think

526
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,039
a great great one to speak about is

527
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,480
parent rooker right

528
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,120
yeah we had him at ddd london before

529
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,600
just before lockdown came in actually

530
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
so what he was telling us was there were

531
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,039
a few there were a few different flavors

532
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,880
of bpmn

533
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,320
systems like

534
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,039
one of the styles and anyone who knows

535
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,320
bpmn is probably

536
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,919
laughing at me right now thinking this

537
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,159
guy knows nothing but basically

538
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,600
what i heard is there are like two

539
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,159
styles of bpmn there's the one style

540
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,440
which tries to

541
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,360
replace developers and put all of your

542
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,159
code inside the bpmn system

543
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,360
which is the ones i've had bad

544
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,760
experiences with it's like hey

545
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,200
we can replace all the developers with

546
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,159
this bpmn tool

547
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,159
and then i said so how do you test it

548
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,760
and they went oh you can write junit

549
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,400
tests

550
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,440
like right you're going to replace all

551
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,600
your developers and who's going to write

552
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,559
the junit test

553
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,720
so that that was my negative experiences

554
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,600
there

555
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,159
but ben was actually talking about a

556
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,159
different kind of bpmn tool where you

557
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,520
define

558
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,760
you define your workflow in the tool

559
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
but you still have your code inside your

560
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,360
separate microservices or whatever

561
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,760
and whenever your microservices complete

562
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,400
some step

563
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,840
they call the bpmn system and so it's

564
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,960
it's kind of um it's kind of visualizing

565
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,559
visualizing the process without

566
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,559
without invading your code base in a way

567
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,000
and i think it's it's becoming

568
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,000
it's becoming the lines between bpmn

569
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,360
and message bus message broker are

570
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,760
starting to blur a bit there

571
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,120
so yeah if anyone doesn't know this

572
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,760
topic please uh feel free to jump in

573
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,840
so if you want to hear a story about

574
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,600
conformance pattern

575
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,440
12 years ago i was working for a company

576
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,919
that

577
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,200
already did some microservices but

578
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,880
80 80 of these services were translators

579
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,159
towards the

580
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,159
self-made enterprise surface bus with a

581
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,280
message broker

582
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,039
of ebm mq wait wait wait can i uh can i

583
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,520
just get some clarification here what do

584
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,760
you mean translators

585
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,799
so um it was an esp pattern with a

586
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,880
canonical data model in the middle so we

587
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,159
were integrating

588
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,440
several systems this was 12 years ago

589
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,640
so right now you will laugh at it but

590
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,520
12 i think it was actually created 15

591
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,640
years ago so it was

592
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,720
ahead of its time back then we had

593
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
proper monitoring on it business

594
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,200
monitoring

595
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,440
on events there are proper events on it

596
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
the only problem was was the canonical

597
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,480
data model in between

598
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,760
that everyone needed to confirm

599
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,400
towards so what happens when you want to

600
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,159
change the canonical data model you need

601
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,840
all these different stakeholders

602
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,960
like 10 to confirm

603
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,240
to the new canonical data model ah

604
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
and the miguel plods got a name for

605
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,440
something like that

606
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,080
he calls it the vetoing consumer where

607
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,120
you've got like

608
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,520
multiple consumers who depend on a

609
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,240
specific

610
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,000
let's say an open host for example

611
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,080
or a partnership maybe it was i don't

612
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,000
know the exact details now

613
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,600
but basically when two of them want

614
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
something to be changed

615
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,880
and the third one says no you can't

616
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,720
change it for some reason

617
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,960
like those kind of politics and i would

618
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,880
say absolutely that is

619
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,919
global complexity

620
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,200
so i've sent the mural board now to uh

621
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,960
to the youtube channel because people

622
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,280
have a hard time seeing it just so you

623
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,080
know so

624
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
afterwards you need to reset the

625
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,120
password or put it on read more

626
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,840
but now people can join in the fun from

627
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,559
youtube

628
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
yeah but that that's that was a hard one

629
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,000
we we tried our we

630
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,840
really decoupled the canonical data

631
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,400
model and went to bounded context

632
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,200
so decoupling it uh locally and that

633
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,440
really worked well

634
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,960
took some time but do i still need to

635
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,720
share my screen is this you recording my

636
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,000
screen or

637
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,640
yeah yeah yeah keep your screen and uh

638
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,279
will be

639
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,559
okay so i'll

640
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,720
have a quick quick look through it seems

641
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,320
event modeling is

642
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,279
proving to be very popular down here

643
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,799
zooming out you can see where

644
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,720
where people tend to gravitate started

645
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,240
with uml

646
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
uml event storming and event modeling

647
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,440
seems to be the three topics

648
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,159
bpmn has been uh

649
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,559
let's say ignored for now but you know i

650
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,120
would i would say that's reflective of

651
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,400
the kind of people who come to this

652
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
meetup there's not much overlap with

653
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,919
bpmn space

654
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,559
but that doesn't reflect on bpmn itself

655
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
so let's have a look at event storming

656
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,600
what do people like about event storming

657
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,440
right level of information it's flexible

658
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,440
and explicit it's easy to read

659
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,039
it's very collaborative yep

660
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,520
it's got a low barrier to entry what's

661
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,320
in a group setting holistic view

662
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,919
what doesn't work about events don't

663
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
mean

664
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,279
so it needs a good facilitator

665
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,840
yeah that

666
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,840
yeah sometimes you get a group of people

667
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,799
together you try and do something

668
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,720
collaboratively

669
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,360
and it has the potential to like event

670
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,279
storming's about chaos right

671
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,559
and you have to manage the chaos so

672
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,080
sessions do tend to go a bit off track

673
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,000
sometimes so i think that's a valid

674
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
concern

675
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,720
needs to be a story i'd be keen

676
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
for whoever wrote that if they want to

677
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,480
speak up about that now or later

678
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,320
because i i like the story format

679
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,440
that was me that was you so what i mean

680
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,799
is it requires a

681
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,559
a user story uh as in a user

682
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,080
journey story uh i remember

683
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,120
three or four years ago uh we modeled

684
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,559
a uh adaptive cruise control

685
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,039
in a session at the ddd netherlands with

686
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,000
alberto there

687
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,240
and we had bruno thomas there we had

688
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,760
marin there

689
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,360
uh we had marco there and uh i think

690
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,400
alexi was there and not sure if you were

691
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,159
there were you there no and paul was

692
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:36,880
there

693
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,120
and we went into groups and people did

694
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,960
some modeling on that part and alberto

695
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,880
took event storming and he hated me ever

696
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,640
since because

697
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,120
adaptive cruise control is is not a

698
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,480
story in its total

699
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,400
right it's it's um you you react on

700
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
certain events

701
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,400
and that's it it's not like this happens

702
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,799
and that's

703
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,159
so it's it's it requires a full

704
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,480
uh user journey to be more viable

705
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,919
okay so something

706
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,480
um so when we move on to the when we

707
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,000
move on to the modeling

708
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,240
later hands-on modeling we could do that

709
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,600
again

710
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,039
the adaptive cruise control with a

711
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,399
different technique if you want to if

712
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,039
you know about that

713
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,120
if you have the instructions that you

714
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,399
could share let's go have a look at uml

715
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,399
so um yeah i think uml is pretty well

716
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,000
known so i can see why

717
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,880
it's got um a bit more negatives

718
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,480
so firstly as an advantage it's a known

719
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
it's a known concept everyone pretty

720
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,760
much knows

721
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,799
your ml sequence diagrams

722
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,480
yeah it does capture the important

723
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
information

724
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,039
it it is it is hard to misinterpret i'll

725
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,240
i'll give you that

726
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,600
like this uml diagram i've taken here

727
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,640
it's pretty clear what's going on there

728
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,120
it is hard to misinterpret that i think

729
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,880
if you if you look at event storming for

730
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,720
example

731
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,799
when we have this event here and these

732
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,520
two contexts

733
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,640
is this is this happening in parallel

734
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,720
or does it mean this happens or this

735
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,399
happens

736
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,399
so with the flexibility of event

737
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,480
storming

738
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,840
yeah it it doesn't always have the full

739
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,600
precision

740
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,760
why does it say query on the screen

741
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,919
sticky in the event storming

742
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,480
picture uh basically this context here

743
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,679
is sending a query to this context here

744
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,600
oh but it looks green so it should be a

745
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,840
read model

746
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,880
so yeah that's uh so i

747
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,640
i did this this is how i would do this

748
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,080
but yeah that's the thing with event

749
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,760
storming i guess right nick

750
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,440
what i've said in the past it's the

751
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,279
concept that matters it's not

752
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,159
the name of the sticky it's more like

753
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:04,799
the

754
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,039
what does it represent and if query

755
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,080
helps

756
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,600
in this case but the problem is we build

757
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,399
habits we we associate things like

758
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,399
oranges and events

759
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,440
green is a read model and so yeah but i

760
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,720
mean the name on

761
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,919
the name you give that concept so

762
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,159
right the event is usually event but in

763
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,600
this case you call

764
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,840
the the the the pink one context

765
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,320
while uh in in other you can call it

766
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,640
external systems in software design

767
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
we call it system in process design and

768
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
in in your version you call it contact

769
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,440
so you adjust the naming

770
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,320
according to the to what you're doing i

771
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,679
think that's powerful

772
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,600
that's the powerful stuff about event

773
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,799
storming you can

774
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,360
leave outcome you can leave out concepts

775
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
or you can rename concepts what works

776
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
for you in a specific

777
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,399
workshop yeah and i i would say

778
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,399
event storming is more flexible in that

779
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,600
respect

780
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,279
yeah but it just means you have to

781
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,880
re-learn some

782
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,200
some the notation each time what things

783
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,279
mean which can be confusing

784
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,919
yeah whereas uml the uml sequence

785
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,840
diagrams are very clear

786
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,000
but it's less flexible i would say

787
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,799
because did you make it green because it

788
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,399
has something to do with the read model

789
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,399
or is just a coincidence it's just the

790
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,600
query elements

791
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,720
it happens to be green yeah i use green

792
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,360
for query and other things so and there

793
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,799
aren't that many colors to choose from

794
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,679
in mirror

795
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,159
yeah so the the yeah the read model is

796
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,600
kind of the

797
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,919
source of the query in a respect so

798
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,039
there is

799
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,320
some relationship there ah i also call

800
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,960
it

801
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,080
i also call it information okay

802
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,840
so it's either query read model

803
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,760
information for me it's the same concept

804
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,080
it's

805
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,760
information yeah

806
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,960
but in this in this diagram here where i

807
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,279
put query

808
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,919
is it is context a querying the read

809
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,159
model of the next context

810
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,000
or is the first context on the left

811
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,080
updating its read model

812
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,159
which the second context is querying

813
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,240
it's not clear because there

814
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,000
there isn't a standard notation we've

815
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,679
been taught in school and we've learned

816
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,799
it forever

817
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,240
like we're making stuff up as we go

818
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,080
along a bit here yeah

819
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,440
which is useful and i think this goes

820
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,919
this goes deeper into the concept of shu

821
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,000
hari the the model for learning

822
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,799
like you start as a beginner you kind of

823
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,720
copy what's there

824
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,559
and then you progress into competent

825
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,840
level

826
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,159
and then you become a master and you

827
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,840
stop following the rules and you

828
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,440
you start applying ad hoc

829
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,240
yeah i'm like a master in a situation

830
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
and i would say that's

831
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,919
that's what's good about event storming

832
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,440
it is flexible

833
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
that you can adapt it to the problem

834
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,880
you're facing

835
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
it it just takes a long time to get to

836
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,399
that stage sometimes

837
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,399
and if if you've got people who are in

838
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,679
the shoe level

839
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,120
and they're still trying to work out

840
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,720
what is event storming and what does a

841
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,480
green thing mean

842
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,159
and they see someone else who's a master

843
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,480
of using it for something else

844
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,559
yeah it can be confusing and confusing

845
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,799
so so i think that's so

846
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,640
fair yeah so i think alberto's last

847
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,720
point is to always abide by the color

848
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,320
coding so there would be a blue in

849
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,840
between

850
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,279
officially but i always say the same

851
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,279
that you say nick

852
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,519
if you think it will be too explicit and

853
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,120
it will be common sense then you just

854
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,039
leave concepts out during

855
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,600
one of these storms and that's what you

856
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,640
did here

857
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,519
yeah it's like oh people if i go to

858
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,360
france i have to drive on the other side

859
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,720
of the road

860
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,799
but i'm so used to driving on the left

861
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,000
side of the road

862
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,519
even though i know i'm supposed to drive

863
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,679
on the right-hand side i've been driving

864
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,799
on the left-hand side for almost 20

865
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,679
years

866
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,080
like it's just a habit there so if i've

867
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,000
been doing event storming for a year

868
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,840
and i've been associating green with one

869
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,360
thing and now it means something else

870
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,039
even if you tell me

871
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,880
like my brain is still like trained to

872
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,159
see it as something else

873
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,399
so it's it's hard to break the

874
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,760
association and the habits

875
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,919
yeah go on yuri sorry yeah usually just

876
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,039
having

877
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,640
the same like board with all the legends

878
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,480
for event storming helps

879
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,559
and as you mentioned it is pretty easy

880
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,320
to invent new concepts

881
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,440
there so we we just tend to have

882
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,120
a legend everywhere and every time

883
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,240
and the drill helps yeah

884
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,919
and that's actually a pretty important

885
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,600
heuristic or what you're just saying

886
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,519
describing yuri and that's not only for

887
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,519
event storming but also for

888
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,679
if you're just doing whiteboards

889
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,720
modeling

890
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,600
sessions always create a legend because

891
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,080
uh

892
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,320
yeah it's better for yourself but also

893
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,000
for people that just joining

894
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,240
you can see oh you mean this with that

895
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,679
and this with that

896
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,960
so thanks for sharing that and nick

897
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
there's a question from nikket saying

898
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,879
what difference between the simple and

899
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,599
advanced domain message flow modeling

900
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,800
thought process wise yeah so on the

901
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,599
simple version here

902
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,440
it's there are fewer concepts

903
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,760
so typically one of the ways to keep

904
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,359
something simple is to reduce the number

905
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,240
of concepts

906
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,280
the fewer concepts there are less less

907
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,280
complexity so with this one

908
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
there's basically an actor a bound of

909
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,760
context a system and a message

910
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,639
and all messages use the same color so

911
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,359
with this

912
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,119
with this diagram i don't have to think

913
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,520
is it a command or query or an events

914
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,639
i just use this notation

915
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,119
and i can change easily like i can

916
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,320
change a command

917
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,560
to an event on this notation very easily

918
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,879
so nick when would you do that when

919
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,119
would you change

920
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,560
that notation uh

921
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,680
so so the simple version is

922
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,280
when you're teaching that i would say

923
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
this is where a good so

924
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,040
usually making something simpler is a

925
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,000
good way to teach it

926
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,119
like teaching people to think about the

927
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,440
a message goes from this context to this

928
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,079
context

929
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,359
i don't want to confuse people with

930
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,119
commands queries or events just yet

931
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,480
let's just keep it simple and think of

932
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,359
everything as a message

933
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,000
so that's when i would do this format

934
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,520
and then

935
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,079
then you get advanced users who do know

936
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:34,800
this concept

937
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,480
well and they're like i want it to be

938
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,920
clear what's a command and what's an

939
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,520
event i want this to stand out

940
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,640
i can i can do advanced pattern matching

941
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,560
and my brain just knows when i see an

942
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,880
event and it has this relationship to a

943
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,640
context and a command

944
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,160
i know that's an anti-pattern i can just

945
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,200
see that so with this advanced format we

946
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,640
have a separate color

947
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,760
for each type of message and we have a

948
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,839
slightly different notation

949
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,079
so with the command it just lives on the

950
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,880
line

951
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,320
but with an event and this was based on

952
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,280
a discussion

953
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,520
in the on the github repo people said

954
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,440
they wanted to see an event separately

955
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,480
from a command

956
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,760
so with an event let's look at the sales

957
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,280
context here

958
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,440
the sales context pushes out the order

959
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,480
placed

960
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,520
and then it goes to the billing context

961
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,160
like we're emphasizing that the sales

962
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,640
context is pushing it out there

963
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,240
but it's not pushing it to the billing

964
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,880
context it's just pushing it out there

965
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,200
and the billing context is then fetching

966
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,359
it

967
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,119
so so who who sees it different

968
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,040
i would like to know so so this is nick

969
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,560
you're you were looking for

970
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,599
uh other opinions so who who would see

971
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,079
it different

972
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,760
yeah so if you if you're an expert or

973
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,599
your experience building messaging

974
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,440
systems and you know commands queries

975
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,330
and events

976
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,079
[Music]

977
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,320
then you can look at this second diagram

978
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,160
here and you can see a lot of blue

979
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,720
commands

980
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,960
and that's usually a sign that

981
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
we normally default towards events so

982
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,240
when you see lots of

983
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,800
commands that's normally a trigger to

984
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,960
look deeper

985
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,119
um let me think of some more examples uh

986
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,000
when you when you see one context and

987
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,839
it's pushing out lots of commands to

988
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,359
other contexts

989
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,839
it might be a sign that's too coupled

990
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,160
it might be a sign that you've got a

991
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,440
process manager

992
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,560
which is fine or it might be a sign that

993
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,079
hey

994
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,240
because this context is sending commands

995
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,720
to lots of other contexts

996
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,320
it's maybe it's got too many

997
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,839
responsibilities in there

998
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,520
whereas if something publishes a lot of

999
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,960
com publishes and not

1000
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,960
five events i wouldn't worry so much

1001
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,680
about that if i saw more commands that

1002
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,920
would indicate more coupling

1003
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,480
generally not not as a rule just as a

1004
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,599
one of those

1005
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,200
pattern matching things you think oh i

1006
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,640
need to look deeper there

1007
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,560
like seeing that combination of commands

1008
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,000
and events

1009
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,760
i've not seen that before or i've seen

1010
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,280
that pattern before

1011
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,800
and it's normally associated with too

1012
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,320
much coupling

1013
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,240
so this version just conveys more

1014
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
information

1015
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,000
all right so the time is up but you can

1016
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,920
you can keep adding feedback if you like

1017
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,320
uh i'll set a timer for 10 more minutes

1018
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,839
and we can just discuss some of these

1019
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,320
some disgusted feedback so if anyone

1020
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,680
does want to speak up

1021
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,760
feel free to pop a message in chat or

1022
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
just start speaking

1023
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,960
and i will continue here

1024
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,880
so message flow modeling can be a hard

1025
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,240
start but simply in the end

1026
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,000
yep i would say one of one of the

1027
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,280
problems going into detail there is

1028
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,520
with a message flow modeling diagram

1029
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,560
like this

1030
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,200
you have to lay things out for yourself

1031
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,040
you're positioning the context and the

1032
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,640
messages of the arrows

1033
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,200
to try and try and make it make the

1034
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,880
design clear

1035
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,880
whereas with uml the layout is automatic

1036
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,640
you don't have to think about that so

1037
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,119
uml is more structured here

1038
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,680
this is a bit more freeform compared to

1039
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,640
uml

1040
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,359
and that can be a bit more complex but

1041
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,520
it also gives you more flexibility to

1042
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,119
highlight

1043
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,400
certain aspects of the coupling

1044
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,720
so one thing to comment there because i

1045
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,440
i did that

1046
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,079
sticky hard stuff but simpler in the end

1047
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,599
last time i did it it was

1048
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,079
you need to get into the concepts

1049
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,520
uh a bit longer than for instance event

1050
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,800
storming where you just begin with

1051
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,920
events right that's

1052
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,720
what i meant but i think what something

1053
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,160
i always say

1054
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,520
um about the structure versus chaotic

1055
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,640
right

1056
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,160
yeah in chaos we gain insights

1057
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,079
if you structure too soon you will

1058
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,480
probably lose valuable insights

1059
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
so that's a heuristic that i always use

1060
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,920
is

1061
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,400
we tend to see start seeing patterns if

1062
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,040
you leave

1063
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,280
gaps open or if you structure it

1064
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,319
differently

1065
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,440
and just because the uml diagram already

1066
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,000
structured

1067
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,400
it for you it's harder to see patterns

1068
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,200
for me or

1069
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,960
odd patterns it's just what you see i

1070
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,880
see too many commands

1071
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,680
or maybe that's an insight and yeah get

1072
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,319
that from

1073
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,359
from uml or from the uml model yeah and

1074
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,240
and also going back to going back to the

1075
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,000
one we just saw

1076
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
like maybe even more important than

1077
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,760
commands is queries

1078
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,680
if you see lots of queries that's

1079
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,960
like okay this this this architecture

1080
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,680
is query based it's all rpc there's no

1081
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,800
messages or events here

1082
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,400
that's normally the distributed monolith

1083
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,240
because you can actually show it oh this

1084
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,760
query calls this

1085
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,520
service and this service queries this

1086
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,079
service you've got like

1087
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,560
a long sequence of chains and if one of

1088
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,960
those calls fails the whole system fails

1089
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,720
like the the runtime coupling

1090
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,680
uh what i would also say about this one

1091
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,720
is

1092
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,640
i agree with your heuristic when you're

1093
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,960
trying to structure something

1094
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,680
that that challenge you have structuring

1095
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,640
things is feedback

1096
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
but also sometimes sometimes there's

1097
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,160
accidental complexity

1098
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,280
where structuring adds no value

1099
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,560
and there's nothing to be gained it's

1100
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,520
just time spent

1101
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,400
so there's a question that

1102
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,880
let's see

1103
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,000
in domain message flow diagram what is

1104
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,520
the difference between system and

1105
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,720
bounded context

1106
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,319
is system something external

1107
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,640
yeah so typically a bounded context is

1108
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,520
it's something in our architecture it's

1109
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,400
a

1110
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,160
it's a part of our domain it's an

1111
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,480
architectural subsystem

1112
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,400
a system is something that's not

1113
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,000
typically part of the domain it

1114
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,440
might be something we build or it could

1115
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,079
be external so in this example i

1116
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,280
consider the website

1117
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,319
our own company website as a system

1118
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,839
i'd probably have a you could have a

1119
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,000
separate notation here for application

1120
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,599
like mobile app website could be a

1121
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,240
separate thing

1122
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,359
uh but most most of the time it will be

1123
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,960
an external system

1124
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,800
in this example there's a mail monkey

1125
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,640
email service and a primo payments

1126
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,440
payment service

1127
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,760
so then i got a question for you there

1128
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,680
uh nick yeah we'll go to the next

1129
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,640
question

1130
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,280
because for me a system and a bounded

1131
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,880
context means something else right

1132
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,680
they're not

1133
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,119
mutually they call it so abundant

1134
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,440
context is about a language boundary

1135
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,680
and a model and there can be several

1136
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,520
bounded contexts in a system

1137
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,200
like for instance a website can have

1138
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,520
several bounded contacts if you model it

1139
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,040
that way

1140
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,480
is that something you already think

1141
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,040
about here

1142
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,119
right do you get where i'm i'm getting

1143
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,640
to

1144
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,319
yeah it's it's the simplicity versus

1145
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,000
precision thing again

1146
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,680
basically a system is anything that's

1147
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,599
not a bounded context

1148
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,440
now inside of websites

1149
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,440
typically i wouldn't consider that to be

1150
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,079
a bounded context in the ddd sense

1151
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,760
but in the general sense it could be

1152
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,040
so for me a website is the front-end

1153
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,760
html css javascript

1154
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,839
that receives commands from the user or

1155
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,000
presents information to the user

1156
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,599
doesn't contain any business logical

1157
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,040
domain rules

1158
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,839
it's just a way to expose the domain

1159
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,200
cool so maybe maybe that would be best

1160
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,880
to call it system slash app

1161
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,520
yeah something like that so some yeah

1162
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,920
it might even i i was thinking about

1163
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,440
also making the distinction

1164
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,800
between what do you own and what is

1165
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,599
really external

1166
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,160
yeah and i think that goes back to

1167
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,760
the similar principles we spoke about

1168
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,599
before we've got we've got a couple of

1169
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,359
principles emerging here

1170
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,480
one is the more notation you add

1171
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,000
the more complex something is because

1172
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,079
there's more things

1173
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,760
to learn and to understand but the fewer

1174
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,480
concepts you had it might look simpler

1175
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,599
but then things become more ambiguous

1176
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:58,880
which we have in this case where our

1177
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,200
system is quite ambiguous

1178
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,359
so it doesn't always mean that fewer is

1179
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,599
better it might mean that having more is

1180
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,760
simpler

1181
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
that's also a good heuristic i think

1182
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,119
that's

1183
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,800
what i always use with event storming

1184
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,720
it's emergent

1185
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,319
notation right once you need it just use

1186
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,520
it

1187
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,280
but start simple and expand from there

1188
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,560
and then then so i'm seeing three three

1189
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,000
degrees of freedom here

1190
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,040
one is about the number of things versus

1191
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,560
precision

1192
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,400
so let's call it simplicity versus

1193
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,800
precision

1194
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,640
then we've got um the other one we spoke

1195
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,119
about

1196
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,079
is structure versus flexibility in terms

1197
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,240
of notation

1198
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,640
and the third one we're coming across is

1199
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,960
is it a design tool or a documentation

1200
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,920
tool

1201
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,280
if it's a design tool then we probably

1202
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,000
want more flexibility there

1203
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,440
because we might be solving novel

1204
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,119
problems and we don't want to be

1205
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,560
constrained

1206
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,480
but if it's a documentation tool

1207
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,760
we might be striving for more

1208
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:14,880
consistency there

1209
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,800
next question is that okay

1210
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,119
yeah yeah keep the questions coming so

1211
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,800
in event storming how would we know

1212
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,880
to what level shall we keep on going to

1213
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
storm out domain events ea when is event

1214
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,720
storming session to be concluded

1215
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,920
as i can have front to end and end to

1216
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
front flow still in place with limited

1217
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,119
domain events on board

1218
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,640
yeah so that's all about

1219
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,480
thinking about the scope of your session

1220
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,640
what would you like to achieve

1221
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,160
firstly um if it's a big picture

1222
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,599
discovery

1223
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,119
then the outcome is a bit

1224
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,920
um blurry you don't really know where

1225
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,839
you'll end up sometimes

1226
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,920
however if your goal is to model your

1227
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,839
bounded contexts

1228
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,240
then

1229
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,640
then there are certain um

1230
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,440
outcomes you can aim for so i'm going to

1231
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,280
move over here

1232
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,319
to what happened to the

1233
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,440
i think we lost the check-in space i

1234
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,160
know we didn't

1235
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,760
i lost myself so you're the outcome of

1236
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,000
your

1237
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,720
workshop might be let's try and create a

1238
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,040
bounded context for one bounded context

1239
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,280
uh let's create a bounded context canvas

1240
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,119
a one bounded context

1241
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,839
and the goal is let's find all of the

1242
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,000
commands queries and events

1243
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,760
related to this bound of context that

1244
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,680
come in or that go out

1245
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,920
that could be the scope of your workshop

1246
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,280
or it might be

1247
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,280
we've got four bounded contexts let's

1248
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,200
try and create a canvas for four of them

1249
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,040
and from that perspective

1250
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,440
i would design the workshop to

1251
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,720
to achieve those things so what would i

1252
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,559
what would i need from the workshop to

1253
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,000
achieve to achieve

1254
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,680
those outcomes what information would i

1255
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,160
need beforehand

1256
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,520
to achieve those things so

1257
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,240
it might be that we've already had an

1258
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,599
event storming workshop

1259
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,599
we've identified our bounded context

1260
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,559
boundaries and that's our starting point

1261
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,359
in that case

1262
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,400
in that case we can create a notation

1263
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,000
for this workshop

1264
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,559
so the notation would be we need some

1265
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,440
symbol for a bounded context

1266
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,920
we need some symbol for a command and

1267
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,520
some symbol for

1268
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,240
a query like we've got here like we just

1269
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,119
need these four bits of notation

1270
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,160
and then we think of the use cases so

1271
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,079
what does this bounded context have to

1272
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,240
do

1273
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,559
it might be you know accept payments

1274
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,040
reject

1275
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,400
payments allow the user to create a new

1276
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,760
credit card

1277
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,319
and then you just model model those

1278
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,240
flows

1279
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,200
and you're looking for every command

1280
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,640
query or events

1281
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,400
that goes in or comes out of the bounded

1282
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,160
context and that's the level of detail

1283
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,880
you stay at

1284
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,079
but sometimes

1285
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,599
you might need to go into more detail

1286
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,240
like you might decide i'm not sure if

1287
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,920
there should be an event or a command

1288
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,800
here

1289
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,640
we just don't know what we're going to

1290
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,720
have to do is

1291
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,800
actually start modeling the internals of

1292
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,079
the bounded context

1293
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,440
like we might have a process manager but

1294
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,520
we might think we need a process manager

1295
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,240
but before we can design the interface

1296
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,160
it might be good to design how it works

1297
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,480
inside first

1298
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,559
so then then you have to adapt the level

1299
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,040
of detail you work at

1300
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,720
so it's it's like we were saying earlier

1301
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,839
when you first get started you have a

1302
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,960
specific notation you follow

1303
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,000
and you have little flexibility but then

1304
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,440
when you become more advanced with the

1305
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,839
tools

1306
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,119
you're adapting as you go along like

1307
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,880
what level of detail what notation

1308
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,839
should we use

1309
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,920
and it's less less predictable from that

1310
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:26,720
respect

1311
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,079
so feel free to uh ask any more

1312
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,440
questions about that i think it's a

1313
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,240
great topic

1314
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,359
i think it's it's that's what i find

1315
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,720
most exciting about this

1316
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,960
when you get to the advanced level and

1317
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,720
you have to be more creative

1318
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,040
and you have to like bend the tools

1319
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,400
rather than following the

1320
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,839
prescribed recipes

1321
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,400
and that's uh don said it last time it

1322
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,480
goes back to the shoe hiring

1323
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,400
when you're in chaos so you don't know

1324
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,920
so when you're in novelty

1325
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,480
just follow the process and casper

1326
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,400
started that ddd process uh

1327
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,520
thing on the ddd crew right and it

1328
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,440
reminds me of that that people getting

1329
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,359
into the ddd space

1330
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,400
just follow that process and because

1331
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,200
you're a novel

1332
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,960
if you're something novel i i've done

1333
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,319
aikido which is

1334
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,680
japanese martial art it's the same

1335
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,319
it's it's might be boring at start but

1336
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,160
just follow the process and

1337
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,240
eventually when you get and they have

1338
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,599
explicit levels right

1339
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,880
like uh at some point you get to a done

1340
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,359
level

1341
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,640
and then you're the re so up until then

1342
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,280
just just

1343
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,960
follow the process and at some point you

1344
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,720
start feeling oh maybe i need to do

1345
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,240
something different here can we are we

1346
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:40,960
still

1347
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,359
within the principles yes okay now we do

1348
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:44,480
it

1349
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,119
but in novelty and in chaos just follow

1350
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,400
that process

1351
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,559
yeah so i would say if you're not sure

1352
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,280
where to start then the first thing is

1353
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,480
clarify your outcome for the workshop

1354
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,440
so try and try and have a focus on what

1355
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,280
you'd like to achieve

1356
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,079
and then whoever's facilitating the

1357
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,680
workshop

1358
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,839
their responsibilities to keep the group

1359
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,760
moving towards that goal

1360
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,960
and if if things go off topic you need

1361
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,160
to bring things back

1362
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,119
on topic sometimes but the problem is

1363
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,200
sometimes things go off topic for a

1364
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,079
valid reason

1365
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,319
and you discover new things and that's

1366
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,160
the more advanced level where it's like

1367
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,119
okay

1368
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,040
let's go off topic for a bit because it

1369
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,200
might be productive

1370
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,680
so yeah if you're a beginner i would say

1371
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,280
have a focus of what you'd like to

1372
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,240
achieve

1373
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,839
and just stay on topic

1374
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,200
and if you if you do go off topic or you

1375
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,880
feel like you want to go off topic

1376
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,200
just put a note to come back later and

1377
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,880
try and get to the outcome first

1378
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,839
all right i'm gonna go check in on the

1379
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,559
bpm tools

1380
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,920
so we did get a bit of feedback

1381
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,240
so someone says activity is a good tool

1382
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,839
i haven't used activity

1383
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,240
um if anyone has used activity i'd like

1384
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,280
to hear about it

1385
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,280
so maybe some other people here would

1386
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,440
too

1387
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,800
uh looks formal looks like you need to

1388
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,040
create an enterprise architect to create

1389
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,839
one

1390
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,599
um i think that's a reasonable

1391
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,240
observation

1392
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,839
it's not about whether something's true

1393
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,520
or false it's about how is something

1394
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,800
perceived

1395
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,760
and i i perceive bpmn tools in a similar

1396
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,640
way

1397
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,160
and i'm always looking to try and

1398
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,920
challenge my opinions

1399
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,480
because one of the things i learned from

1400
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,400
simon wardly and his wardly mapping

1401
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,640
concept is that

1402
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,839
every evolution goes through stages

1403
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,440
and even if the current version of

1404
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,200
evolution

1405
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,319
isn't working for you there might be an

1406
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,319
evolution of that that comes along and

1407
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,880
changes the constraints or

1408
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,240
changes the pros and cons of that tool

1409
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,599
and the new version um

1410
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,480
is useful and is beneficial so i'm

1411
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,319
always

1412
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,400
i'm always thinking look there are so

1413
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,599
many people

1414
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,440
who use bpmn there's got to be something

1415
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,640
useful there

1416
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,640
it can't be a just a complete waste of

1417
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,079
time there's got to be something useful

1418
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,040
there

1419
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,800
there are some smart people working in

1420
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,359
that space

1421
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,760
and they're not standing still are they

1422
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,440
they're constantly innovating so

1423
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,880
who knows like one day the bpmn

1424
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,839
community

1425
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,520
they might invent something better than

1426
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,040
event storming

1427
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,160
so i'm always open to seeing what could

1428
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,839
happen there like always keeping my mind

1429
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,839
open

1430
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,799
and maybe now that we're all working

1431
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,599
remotely maybe some of the bpmn tools

1432
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:07,839
are more suitable

1433
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,240
so there's another question from osun

1434
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,240
saying is it okay to model every single

1435
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,440
scenario that needs to be

1436
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,359
implemented in design level event

1437
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,760
storming

1438
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,240
so i i can take i can take that one if

1439
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:20,880
you

1440
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,920
if you want so for software design level

1441
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,559
software design level is a 2b right it's

1442
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,119
what we want the system to behave

1443
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,079
once we created it

1444
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,359
so there's this uh in in

1445
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,640
alberto's book you'll see that thing and

1446
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,200
i think i

1447
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,599
also put it on the ddd crew site where

1448
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:42,720
you first

1449
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,559
always always first rush well not rush

1450
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,680
the happy path so finish your story

1451
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,799
nobody likes a unfinished story

1452
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,680
that's george that's uh some thing to

1453
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,599
george rr martin right

1454
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,480
we want that finished story so first do

1455
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,440
that

1456
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,960
and whenever you feel like you're

1457
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,960
jumping in like i'm a developer so we

1458
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,079
want to jump into

1459
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,720
if then else's right cases we look in

1460
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,440
cases

1461
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,599
you just hot spot them your hot spot

1462
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,119
there's more to discover here

1463
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,119
you finish the happy flow part you make

1464
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,200
sure that that's night

1465
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,160
and neatly abide by the color coding and

1466
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:20,960
then you just

1467
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,280
explore the most prioritized

1468
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,359
use cases and you go deeper so it will

1469
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:31,760
be top to bottom

1470
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,440
thing just hope that that answers a bit

1471
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,799
your question

1472
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,250
i'm looking now for the

1473
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,400
[Music]

1474
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,640
let's see if i can quickly pick up that

1475
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,599
picture

1476
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,079
show it

1477
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,160
no i don't think so so

1478
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,799
that does that answer your question also

1479
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:59,040
hopefully

1480
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,880
so nick how would you remodel

1481
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,680
integration between two external systems

1482
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,680
a question from uh unseat

1483
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,720
i need to zoom in the chat

1484
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,119
zoom is like really small i'm not sure

1485
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,319
if you have the same problem

1486
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,680
so um we can pick up the

1487
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,440
continue it are you still there nick

1488
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,000
yeah i just wanted to turn my lights on

1489
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,599
ah okay

1490
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,359
yeah so how would we model integration

1491
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,480
between two external systems

1492
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,040
integration between two external systems

1493
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,599
so if

1494
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,440
both systems are external and they're

1495
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,559
communicating with each other

1496
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,880
um that seems like it's outside of my

1497
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,839
responsibility

1498
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,160
i'm trying to think about a situation

1499
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,079
where i've had that scenario

1500
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,760
before i'm trying to work out

1501
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,640
yeah so i think i've had this before

1502
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,559
where

1503
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,240
where you get data from another system

1504
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,000
and it's useful to know where they get

1505
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,040
the data from there's like a chain

1506
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,319
um i would say depends on what we're

1507
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:14,880
trying to

1508
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,920
what we're trying to gain from that

1509
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,160
if it's from a relationship perspective

1510
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,079
in terms of the contracts

1511
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,839
then i think context mapping is a good

1512
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,680
tool there

1513
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,240
if we want to know what the messages and

1514
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,520
what are the payloads and the

1515
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,160
conversations between those two services

1516
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,160
then context mapping is not so good

1517
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,599
there context mappings about the

1518
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,880
structure

1519
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,559
like this thing is connected to this

1520
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,559
thing and they have this relationship

1521
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,119
the tools we've got here on the miro

1522
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,319
board

1523
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,040
i'd be probably picking one of these so

1524
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:49,680
so my

1525
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,359
my thinking on this topic is

1526
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,000
if i want to model a long sequence of

1527
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,599
interactions

1528
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,240
then i would use event storming or

1529
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,079
something with swim lanes like story

1530
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,119
storming or

1531
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,920
maybe event modelling if i had a very

1532
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,520
simple scenario

1533
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,599
and i wanted to document it on an a4

1534
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,599
piece of paper

1535
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,160
i would use the message flow modeling so

1536
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,520
when the scope is small

1537
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,839
i prefer message flow modeling because i

1538
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:20,319
can just see the relationships easier

1539
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,000
when the sequence of interactions is

1540
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,760
longer

1541
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,319
so i always say when you're doing

1542
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,240
message flow modeling

1543
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,319
if you've got more than seven messages

1544
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:31,440
on the diagram

1545
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,520
that it's you've got too much going on

1546
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,680
there make smaller diagrams

1547
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,359
if you want something bigger then i

1548
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:38,880
would go with event storming

1549
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,319
or event modeling in that case

1550
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,559
so yeah it will be one of those tools

1551
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,400
basically am i looking at the structural

1552
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,520
relationship

1553
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,839
and the organizational aspects or am i

1554
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,359
looking at the conversations the

1555
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,359
messages flowing backwards and forwards

1556
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,240
and the payloads that would help me to

1557
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,599
choose

1558
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,480
which technique there

1559
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,599
so i'm going to quickly go over event

1560
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:14,400
modeling now discuss the feedback here

1561
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,240
and then then we can take like a

1562
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,920
15-minute break and then we can come

1563
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,280
back and do some hands-on modeling

1564
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,680
so event storming is a nice to read

1565
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,000
model

1566
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,480
so if we if we look across here what

1567
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,319
stands out to me here

1568
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,880
i can see these swim lanes down here i

1569
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,880
guess these are my actors or my services

1570
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:35,440
so

1571
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,160
yeah that's pretty clear event storming

1572
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,839
uses the same

1573
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:43,359
colors for commands queries and events

1574
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,599
so as someone who's used that notation

1575
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,599
before i can adapt to this easier

1576
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:48,480
because i know it

1577
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,760
because standards there

1578
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,880
um it it does look a bit complex to me

1579
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,720
though i don't understand all of it

1580
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,040
at first glance i guess you need to

1581
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,799
learn all of these techniques

1582
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,960
i think someone said it down here yeah

1583
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,839
it looks a bit complex to start

1584
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:09,119
which i think is a fair there's quite a

1585
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,640
few different kinds of concepts here

1586
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,640
like we talked about before

1587
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,000
there's the swim lanes there's the

1588
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,400
arrows there's the line here the bits at

1589
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,400
the top

1590
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,839
it's not a huge amount but when you

1591
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,440
first look at this it can be

1592
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,280
it can be a bit in your face daunting

1593
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,200
until you learn it so i think both of

1594
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,880
those comments are fair

1595
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,319
i think this one here is good i've never

1596
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,920
thought about this

1597
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,640
so event storming shows the ui but we

1598
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,839
care about ux

1599
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:40,240
so i think i always think it's good to

1600
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,440
think about the ui

1601
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,880
when you're designing the back end

1602
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
systems like how will the

1603
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,319
how will the boundaries of the

1604
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,079
architecture and the communications

1605
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,599
affect the ui

1606
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,720
but what the point here is well ui is

1607
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,640
not ux

1608
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,280
are we coupling are we coupling the back

1609
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,119
end to the ui

1610
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,400
when the ui might change frequently or

1611
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,079
or the ux and the back end might be

1612
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,240
designed separately

1613
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,599
so i think that's that made me think

1614
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,200
actually that this one here made me

1615
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,200
think a lot

1616
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,160
um and so yeah up here includes the ui

1617
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,760
which we often do forget

1618
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,880
which i like about event modeling

1619
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,160
it's detailed enough to drive

1620
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,240
development which i think is useful

1621
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,680
so going back to the question from

1622
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,680
earlier how do you decide what the scope

1623
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,160
is

1624
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,039
when do you start when do you stop if

1625
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,640
your goal is to actually start

1626
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,200
developing after after the session

1627
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,799
maybe you want something like event

1628
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,119
modelling which is much closer to the

1629
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,920
implementation

1630
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,240
all context in one model

1631
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,720
yep i think this is useful when we think

1632
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,319
about the messages flowing between

1633
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,359
bounded contexts

1634
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,520
people often have like commands events

1635
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,359
and queries which is important

1636
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,280
but they don't show the payload on those

1637
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,599
messages

1638
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:02,960
and when you start thinking about the

1639
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,839
payload like which information needs to

1640
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,440
be on this message

1641
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,400
then you realize oh the context sending

1642
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,599
this message

1643
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,359
doesn't actually have that piece of data

1644
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:14,720
to put on the message

1645
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,400
and it forces you to reevaluate the

1646
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,039
design whereas event modelling makes you

1647
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,319
think about the data that's being

1648
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,200
transferred around

1649
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,280
someone says here it's a good mixture

1650
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,079
which i think is fair

1651
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,599
someone here says in combination with

1652
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,280
event storming which i think is also

1653
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,520
fair

1654
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,200
uh someone here says it takes

1655
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,079
assumptions to go to cqrs es

1656
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,680
i don't have a lot of experience doing

1657
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,200
that so if anyone wants to speak up

1658
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,680
uh yeah it does uh adam speaks quite

1659
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,799
often that uh

1660
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,440
everything should be secured as yes and

1661
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,000
everything

1662
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,280
by nature is uh eventually consistent

1663
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,079
and everything's right

1664
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,520
that's i mean he speaks a lot about this

1665
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,319
so i think it's a fair point i i'm not

1666
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,920
the one that i wrote that by the way i'm

1667
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,720
just saying that it's

1668
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,119
it's a fair point okay so we know it was

1669
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,640
you now shall i put your name on this

1670
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,839
one

1671
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,079
uh i didn't write that my iraqi one

1672
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:10,960
directly in the

1673
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,359
on the left of that to be honest but i'm

1674
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,920
just saying it's a fair point as i said

1675
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,960
adam makes a lot of uh

1676
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,240
uh very regularly mentioned yeah

1677
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,240
i think there are yeah so the one to the

1678
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,480
left here and this one over here

1679
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,640
so i've not used event modeling but it

1680
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,680
looks to me like

1681
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,599
some of the patterns you can do in event

1682
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,440
storming around collaboration

1683
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,160
don't fit here so with event storming

1684
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:36,720
you can show

1685
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,520
parallel processes i don't know how you

1686
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,000
would do that

1687
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
here it looks like you've only got one

1688
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,960
one conversation happening here it's one

1689
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,240
sequential step of offense

1690
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,240
yeah i wrote both of those tickets by

1691
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,119
the way so the reason i mentioned that

1692
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,960
it's not very collaborative is because

1693
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,440
i mean it's what i write below it's it

1694
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
lacks that brainstorming

1695
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,240
ability it's it's too structured to

1696
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,960
facilitate

1697
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,240
that aspect of putting on ideas and then

1698
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,839
deciding to try something different and

1699
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,440
then dropping it down

1700
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,520
which event storming really really helps

1701
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,880
and facilitates

1702
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,839
so it's much it's from my experience i

1703
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,520
will say it's really good for the

1704
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,200
requirement of structure

1705
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,799
requirement extraction in a more

1706
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,280
structured way but not really helpful

1707
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,280
with brainstorming itself

1708
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,960
and the aspect with some workflows don't

1709
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,480
feel the available patterns

1710
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,480
is that event modeling has

1711
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,280
a certain part patterns uh with regards

1712
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,960
to how messages flow

1713
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,119
happens and there are a couple of cases

1714
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,440
where this is not exactly

1715
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,319
and this doesn't exactly fit especially

1716
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,039
when you have

1717
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,119
longer running processes driven by

1718
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:52,559
events without

1719
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,680
necessarily having to stick them in

1720
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,880
views first anyway just some

1721
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,640
cases where it doesn't strictly fit the

1722
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,880
available patterns

1723
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,559
yeah and something you were saying there

1724
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,720
about structure goes back to what we

1725
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,920
talked about earlier

1726
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,119
where we were comparing the flexibility

1727
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,359
of event storming

1728
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,359
with the structure of uml and the pros

1729
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,559
and cons there

1730
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,599
if we look at event modeling it's kind

1731
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,440
of in between the two

1732
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,599
yeah i have a bit less structure than

1733
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:24,640
uml

1734
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,480
but a bit more structure than event

1735
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,240
storming

1736
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,520
um with uml i feel like

1737
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,440
i can see exactly what's happening

1738
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,760
between two services

1739
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,280
like this goes from here to here it's

1740
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,200
very clear

1741
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,119
but looking at this one

1742
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:45,920
it's not always clear to me which event

1743
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,000
is going where but maybe i need to learn

1744
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,400
this more

1745
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,559
i mean this is supposed to be as you see

1746
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,480
the time flows from left to right as

1747
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,319
well so you're supposed

1748
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,920
i think you do get that piece of

1749
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,520
information you don't get like

1750
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,280
lifetime scopes uh in

1751
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,839
in event modeling but you do get that

1752
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:09,920
flowing sequence of things quite nicely

1753
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,920
in my opinion so that exists and

1754
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,200
it does have that similarity i think

1755
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,559
from my perspective it

1756
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,880
i i do agree perfectly with your or with

1757
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,319
your assessment i did see it somewhere

1758
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:23,760
in between

1759
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,000
um i tried it a couple of times

1760
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,240
maybe someone else i don't know can

1761
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,400
voice some opinions

1762
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,799
yeah i was just about to ask because

1763
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,039
there's a lot of on the upside

1764
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:40,240
and is there anyone

1765
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,920
wish to speak out on the upper side i

1766
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,119
really like to hear those

1767
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,799
by the way it's just started raining

1768
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:51,920
here very heavily

1769
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,359
now i need to check my uh

1770
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,520
maybe you can send some of the rain to

1771
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,559
us

1772
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,799
so what keeping it interesting thing

1773
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:03,680
nick

1774
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,680
it's what i'm thinking about is about

1775
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,160
the flow and everything and don

1776
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,480
is now currently writing about surface

1777
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,920
blueprint

1778
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,400
have you ever heard of that one yeah

1779
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,080
there's a mirror template for that too

1780
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:16,560
should i

1781
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,279
shall i import one into here now i've

1782
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:20,960
i've put a picture on

1783
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,359
on the right side i'll put it on the

1784
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:24,960
bottom side

1785
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,719
so it's a reminder to me a bit about

1786
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,560
this uh

1787
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,279
but this is a lot nicer structure it it

1788
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,080
doesn't hold the bounded context in

1789
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,239
of course because there's a line of

1790
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:38,400
visibility which reminded me of

1791
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,319
a bit of wartly right the visibility

1792
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,520
perhaps but perhaps

1793
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,319
here you can also add in a line with the

1794
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,159
bounded contexts right

1795
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:54,159
that was just popping in my mind now

1796
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,520
looking at that yeah so with the

1797
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,040
bounded context it's a bit closer to the

1798
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,719
implementation i think the service

1799
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:03,839
blueprints

1800
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:07,040
looking at this for the first time

1801
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,480
looks a bit more high level

1802
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,440
yeah yeah and i'm just wondering if

1803
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,880
anyone ever done that

1804
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,440
because that was just an experiment

1805
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,279
experimentation i thought of

1806
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,640
doing and it looks like this this

1807
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,040
this refers to a service as an end to

1808
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,480
end service not

1809
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,759
not a technical service no let's say a

1810
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,600
service for

1811
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,440
shopping online this could this looks

1812
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,040
like it involves multiple bounded

1813
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,279
contexts like maybe each one of these

1814
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,759
actions here and i think there it goes

1815
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,040
wrong right because

1816
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,239
i think these people call uh surface

1817
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:45,839
designers

1818
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:49,040
and it's more of a user service designer

1819
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:49,440
and

1820
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,359
a bounded contact is an implementation

1821
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,480
detail while

1822
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,640
this is more of a reality like the

1823
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,760
problem

1824
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,840
yes right yeah this is probably

1825
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,360
something

1826
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,320
more on the enterprise strategic level

1827
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,440
product level

1828
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,719
portfolio level yeah but you should be

1829
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,800
able to drill down i guess

1830
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,080
yeah i think it would be great to have a

1831
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,840
meet up on this topic looking at this

1832
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,960
service blueprint now it might be a way

1833
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,480
to connect the two different worlds of

1834
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,920
domain driven design

1835
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,880
plus service design so if you can see i

1836
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,520
think

1837
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,760
yeah it's the same i think susan kaiser

1838
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,760
did at ddd europe last year with worldly

1839
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,320
mapping

1840
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,600
towards bounded contacts

1841
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,920
and surface design that was really that

1842
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,199
was really nice talk

1843
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:36,320
yeah her talk was great a lot of

1844
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,000
a lot of information packed into that

1845
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,760
talk i was looking forward to watching

1846
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,280
the talk but i don't think it's been

1847
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,800
published yet

1848
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,600
like re-watching it basically i've seen

1849
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:45,920
the

1850
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,640
slides so it gives me some information

1851
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,320
let's see if we have more do we want to

1852
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,840
take a break nick or

1853
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,600
ask a few more uh questions so

1854
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,040
let's say i'll set a timer for 15

1855
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,280
minutes

1856
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,120
and then we'll do the hands-on modeling

1857
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,880
after this break

1858
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,880
but anyone who doesn't want to take a

1859
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,239
break and wants to stay here we can

1860
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:13,440
carry on discussing things

1861
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,880
and then we'll split into the breakup

1862
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,920
groups in 15 minutes

1863
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,239
so let's uh see a couple of more

1864
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,480
questions right continue to event stormy

1865
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,159
questions and your inputs

1866
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,719
we have started the workshop recently

1867
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,719
decently put up board gives good picture

1868
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,159
of business flow but still looks

1869
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,320
immature for next level to be able

1870
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,640
to define boundary context so know the

1871
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,800
point of define a goal of workshop

1872
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,600
yeah about that about about the goal is

1873
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,480
a template i

1874
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,239
i usually use uh and it's something

1875
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:49,199
out of the book of david sibbett visual

1876
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,640
meetings i'm not sure if anyone's

1877
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,440
familiar with that

1878
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,960
but let me put it can you can you post

1879
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,640
this template you use onto the mirror

1880
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,280
board

1881
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,000
yeah i'm i'm trying i was trying to copy

1882
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,640
paste it but

1883
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,440
oh wow we've got a thunderstorm now did

1884
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,719
you want one of those or did you just

1885
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:09,920
want the rain yeah

1886
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,520
no thunderstorm is also fine so he uses

1887
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,719
this template in his book

1888
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,600
and it's called visual meetings like me

1889
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,800
can you can you hear that

1890
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:31,120
can you hear it no a bid

1891
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,440
well my house just vibra my whole house

1892
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,840
just shook from the thunder

1893
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,920
ah what's this

1894
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,600
so this is from this book so here it

1895
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,560
says

1896
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,000
and this is what we usually do in

1897
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
workshops nowadays

1898
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,800
we define a rough agenda then we have

1899
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,560
some roles right who's the

1900
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,679
facilitator we put up some rules we add

1901
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,199
the rules with the people right i

1902
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,320
usually have

1903
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,320
one rule my uh my main rule is always

1904
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,920
everyone's right and nobody has to

1905
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,920
monopoly to the truth that's my core

1906
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,719
rule right that means it's just

1907
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,040
perceptions and we're trying to

1908
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,280
and the second one following up there is

1909
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,960
it's okay to change your mind

1910
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,760
based on other people's perception right

1911
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,600
and then the outcomes is that's what

1912
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,280
triggered me right you want to define

1913
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,560
the outcomes what are we doing today

1914
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,840
and this helps people

1915
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,960
in the chaos of a group structure

1916
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,239
so another one was

1917
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,080
is david still here yeah so does which

1918
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,920
to us appropriately evolve the

1919
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,239
relationship with the client progresses

1920
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,320
from first discussion of functionality

1921
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,239
to illicitly requirements for the first

1922
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,640
time to cycle of adding functionality

1923
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,880
i do not have a sense of when to use

1924
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,400
worldly mapping and when to use event

1925
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,640
storming i thinking of

1926
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,800
illustrating events then worldly mapping

1927
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,400
and then drill down with more events

1928
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,080
storming for details on most

1929
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,679
immediate work well it's something you

1930
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,600
also talked about and

1931
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,679
i think uh casper in the dd crew

1932
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,960
talked about right want to share

1933
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,040
something there nick or casper

1934
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,440
[Music]

1935
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,560
i can share as well sure i've got some

1936
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,080
thoughts here

1937
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,000
firstly i would say there is no

1938
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,640
perfect starting point you could start

1939
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,640
with either of those tools

1940
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,080
and both tools will give you insights

1941
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,719
and probably make you more productive

1942
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,520
when you use the next one

1943
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,080
um

1944
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:56,800
i think

1945
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,560
what would be the heuristics i would use

1946
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,159
or what would be the characteristics i'm

1947
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,679
looking for about choosing each

1948
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,400
technique so

1949
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:11,040
sometimes sometimes it's useful to talk

1950
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:11,520
about

1951
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,560
the business strategy first

1952
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,159
like what are the goals of the company

1953
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,880
where are we looking to go as a company

1954
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,239
and investing in an event storming

1955
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,760
workshop

1956
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,120
getting a bunch of people together

1957
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,560
modeling things collaboratively

1958
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,159
that can be a big leap for some

1959
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,320
companies it can be a lot of effort i

1960
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,159
love buying

1961
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,360
taking a lot of time out of people's

1962
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,679
calendars

1963
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,480
and it might be too big a step sometimes

1964
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,840
whereas tools like

1965
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,880
wardly mapping or the business model

1966
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,120
canvas

1967
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,320
you can start mapping out the high level

1968
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,280
of their business

1969
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,199
just just the main concepts like how do

1970
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,560
you make money what are your key

1971
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,640
services what services do you depend on

1972
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,159
and you can start having conversations

1973
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:06,080
about what are your properties right now

1974
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,920
how is your landscape evolving what's

1975
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,120
your focus for the future

1976
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,360
and then if those sessions go well

1977
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,480
and people feel like you've understood

1978
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,760
their company

1979
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,520
and you've provided some insight and

1980
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,880
value

1981
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,400
people might be happy to jump into an

1982
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,239
event storming session

1983
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,600
and commit more time and effort to

1984
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,360
exploring the space and looking for

1985
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,600
possibilities

1986
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,600
a lot of a lot of companies have heard

1987
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,880
of event storming now

1988
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,640
they know it's a proven technique and

1989
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,640
they're very keen to try it

1990
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,400
and the outcome of an event storming

1991
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,760
session might be

1992
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,480
we've got lots of opportunities here

1993
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,239
lots of problems

1994
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,320
how do we decide which ones to focus on

1995
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,000
as a company

1996
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,320
and uh that can happen in event storming

1997
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,880
right you uncover lots of problems

1998
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,640
and everyone feels like their problems

1999
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,480
are the most important

2000
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,840
you've got years of legacy debts uh

2001
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,800
years of legacy and organizational debts

2002
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,920
and there's a lot of problems in the

2003
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,320
company like where do we start

2004
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,000
and that's where wardly mapping is

2005
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,719
useful it's a way to step back and look

2006
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,040
at the priorities

2007
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,239
where does the company want to go

2008
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,760
how does it want to develop its business

2009
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,320
capabilities from where it is now

2010
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,400
to some future target and

2011
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,239
and event storming is very detailed with

2012
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,679
lots of information

2013
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,000
and you want to condense that into

2014
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,040
something shorter where you can focus on

2015
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,360
like business level initiatives and

2016
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,800
capabilities

2017
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,360
so in summary you can do either

2018
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,880
technique first it it

2019
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,440
depends on a couple of things do you

2020
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,239
want to

2021
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,679
do you want to get the details first or

2022
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:53,199
do you want to think strategically first

2023
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,440
i have a i have a question there if it's

2024
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,800
sorry yes or can he

2025
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,840
uh now go on i mean the so

2026
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,640
i'm first of all i've i've been working

2027
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,679
permanent to

2028
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,480
all companies like for a long time now

2029
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,320
uh but one thing that i've seen

2030
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,920
at least in the companies i've worked

2031
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,600
with uh

2032
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,280
what we did event storming and even

2033
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,040
before that is that there is

2034
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,920
definitely a lot of disalignment between

2035
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,440
the different departments

2036
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,840
and each case where we actually try to

2037
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:22,560
do

2038
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,440
uh big picture events for me at least i

2039
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,239
was

2040
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,239
well i mean i personally not very

2041
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,480
surprised but the consistent picture is

2042
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,920
that always people

2043
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,440
left that session with like they were

2044
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,880
actually saying that this was really

2045
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,280
useful because they finally understand

2046
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,440
what everybody else is doing and they

2047
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,560
understand the bigger

2048
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,679
bigger picture more than just the

2049
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,120
mission statement or whatever the ceo

2050
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,000
share globally and this is really useful

2051
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,960
for everyone i mean

2052
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,960
it facilitates discussion more than

2053
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,640
anything that i've ever personally at

2054
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,320
least seen so

2055
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,640
the question is that i mean that's a

2056
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,880
comment and then every question

2057
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,920
um that i wanted to ask is really

2058
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,960
if how does that exactly fit i mean i

2059
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,800
i um i can see the benefits with working

2060
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,520
up him

2061
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,840
but if you don't have that alignment how

2062
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,600
does worldly mapping

2063
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,120
ahead i mean that i i don't know i'm not

2064
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,000
trying to be

2065
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,239
uh just i'm honestly trying to

2066
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,520
understand

2067
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,080
yeah so so i can pitch in there so for

2068
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:28,640
me

2069
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,800
my main heuristic is if i can do a big

2070
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,480
picture event storming so i mean big

2071
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,760
picture

2072
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,080
whole domain or depending on how big

2073
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,760
your size is i will always go for the

2074
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,159
big picture event swimming

2075
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:44,320
downside you need a lot of people

2076
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,320
having to lock their agenda for eight

2077
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,679
hours on the same day

2078
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,239
well that there's already one thing if

2079
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:53,920
if an organization cannot do that that's

2080
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,960
already a smell

2081
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,480
right that's what you just said uh

2082
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,560
probably it might be a dysfunctional one

2083
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,480
but if i want to pick i will always go

2084
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,159
for a big picture event storming to

2085
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,159
know what is there now what knowledge is

2086
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,679
there and from there

2087
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,719
i can start distilling a context map or

2088
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:11,840
a worldly map

2089
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,040
or a or a business model canvas

2090
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,400
because then i know what's there and

2091
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,199
then i can then later on decide

2092
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:22,400
okay and and there's a nice talk uh

2093
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:26,239
about explorer ddd

2094
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,800
first year by javier using the bounded

2095
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,520
con

2096
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,080
the business model canvas to be filled

2097
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,040
in by

2098
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,520
the developers and by the cto and then

2099
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,719
match them

2100
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,440
right look oh we've got there's a

2101
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,719
difference here i didn't know we had

2102
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,159
that surface

2103
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,639
the the cto said oh now now we have a

2104
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:47,679
new service so i always would pick

2105
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,199
going big picture event streaming with

2106
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,760
the people who built stuff

2107
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,480
saying that it's a lot of effort and

2108
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,040
sometimes managers don't have that time

2109
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,440
or c-level people don't have that time

2110
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,360
so i'll just start to do a worldly map

2111
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,000
with them

2112
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,719
and then start to go to other people

2113
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:05,120
same

2114
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,719
thing you would do with a context map

2115
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,400
start doing that with one

2116
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,600
person or two people in a room do that

2117
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,159
and then go to other people the the goal

2118
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:15,280
of a worldly map

2119
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,760
is the mapping is is the practice of

2120
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,320
mapping

2121
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,199
it's not the map itself so it's the the

2122
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:21,600
the

2123
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,679
conversations you're having so if i

2124
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:25,679
capture a worldly map conversation

2125
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:27,760
with one person i can do it with another

2126
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,840
person and capture that as well and gain

2127
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,120
new insights and

2128
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,400
thus doing it bear more a bit more

2129
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,400
asynchronous and at some point you'll

2130
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,080
start feeling the pain

2131
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,840
that maybe we need we need to sit

2132
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,440
together in one room and

2133
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,320
figure this stuff out together and then

2134
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,280
do it together

2135
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,760
so that that's what you said nick it

2136
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,600
doesn't matter which approach you take

2137
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,320
i know i think i think it can matter but

2138
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,440
sometimes it can

2139
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,440
but it depends on the context some yeah

2140
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,760
it depends on the context and i think

2141
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,360
i think there are two things to keep in

2142
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,360
mind here like from a general

2143
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,440
perspective we always have this choice

2144
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,080
of

2145
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,360
top-down or bottom-up ways of

2146
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,280
approaching a problem and

2147
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,880
since we since it's a uh it's a problem

2148
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,639
space we don't have the solutions for

2149
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,400
with many unknowns we don't know which

2150
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,159
approach is best

2151
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,000
so we use heuristics to work out which

2152
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,440
technique

2153
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,480
and then so in any situation

2154
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,000
either of those approaches could be a

2155
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,239
good best first step

2156
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,239
in an ideal world and then there are the

2157
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,920
constraints we face

2158
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,239
which may make the ideal solution not

2159
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,000
possible anyway

2160
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,679
like like kenny was talking about and

2161
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:42,480
the second thing is

2162
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,440
both of those tools work at different

2163
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,280
levels of abstraction

2164
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,440
like you can wardly map your entire

2165
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,639
company

2166
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,760
or one department or

2167
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,880
just your it system and not not some of

2168
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,440
the other business parts

2169
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,520
kind of same with event storming like

2170
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,920
even big picture can mean

2171
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,400
big big picture or just quite big

2172
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,080
picture

2173
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,760
so that's always the first question that

2174
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,920
people ask here but how big is big who

2175
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,880
do we invite

2176
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,679
and i said well try to invite as many as

2177
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:16,400
possible but

2178
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,480
a good capability model for instance

2179
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,239
would already help then we can pick

2180
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:22,880
already a slice out of that system i

2181
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:23,280
think

2182
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:26,000
i think the heuristics for me would be

2183
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:26,880
which of those

2184
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,239
techniques is going to deliver something

2185
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:31,840
useful immediately

2186
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,360
and gain buy-in to spend more time

2187
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,639
discovering so if my feeling is

2188
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,400
there are too many dysfunctions here

2189
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,199
event storming won't work to start with

2190
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,840
and that might lead me towards would be

2191
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,280
mapping for example

2192
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,800
or it might lead me towards

2193
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,800
um a smaller scope of big picture event

2194
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,760
storming

2195
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,800
and doing multiple of those sessions if

2196
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,280
i

2197
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,159
look at a company and i think like if i

2198
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,880
wardly map it myself and i think hey

2199
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,719
there are some obvious things going on

2200
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,320
in this company's

2201
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,679
domain a wardley map is a very quick way

2202
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,040
to make them clear

2203
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:17,679
then i would go wardly mapping first

2204
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:20,080
so yeah each of the tools could be a

2205
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,480
good first step

2206
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,000
okay thank you very much that was really

2207
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,600
useful thanks

2208
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,320
now another question from renat is did

2209
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,360
we consider an

2210
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,520
arena still here i hope did we consider

2211
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,000
using user story mapping technique

2212
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,840
it's not strictly message oriented

2213
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,280
though uh

2214
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,199
reena there you are maybe you can ask

2215
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,480
the question yourself

2216
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:45,120
yeah so i know that um the um

2217
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,239
so um yeah the user story mapping um is

2218
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,120
it

2219
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,239
the technique that is well it's

2220
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:55,120
helps to um to structure the backlog as

2221
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,040
well as i think it's kind of close to

2222
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:57,760
you

2223
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,800
what you would have in the

2224
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,719
ux uh customer journey maps

2225
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,239
um the my the pro the one thing that i

2226
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:08,719
had

2227
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:11,760
like one problem that i have is

2228
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,639
with using event storming that they tend

2229
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:15,520
to be

2230
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,040
um let's say on the back end side

2231
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,600
or api side so to speak if you talk go

2232
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,120
through technology

2233
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,520
if you apply to technology implement it

2234
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,440
if you use it as i think for technology

2235
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,560
implementations

2236
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,960
but once uh you kind of start talking to

2237
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,480
the ux guys

2238
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,199
it's uh you do not get that much that

2239
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,280
many of the communications

2240
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,320
so user story mapping allows us kind of

2241
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,159
to create the scenarios and look through

2242
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:42,880
them

2243
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:46,159
uh but it lacks the messaging uh aspect

2244
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:46,639
of

2245
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,480
all other techniques that we presented

2246
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,239
here so

2247
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:53,120
did we consider it uh what kind of

2248
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,760
positives negatives we have about

2249
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,800
this particular approach

2250
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,719
i think this is uh one of kenny's

2251
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,639
favorite topics kenny's always talking

2252
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,000
about blind spots

2253
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,120
blind spots blind spots blind spots

2254
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,040
he's talking about rain a lot today but

2255
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,639
when he's not talking about rain he's

2256
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:11,360
talking about still

2257
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,639
no rain still no rain okay and

2258
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:18,159
uh yeah so for me user story mapping um

2259
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:20,800
and alberto said it as well i i believe

2260
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,080
is a pretty interesting technique

2261
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,480
especially to go to a

2262
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,960
a pretty well defined backlog the only

2263
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:27,679
thing

2264
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,400
i dislike is the focus on commands so

2265
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,040
tasks instead of events

2266
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,520
but it's scoped right it's usually

2267
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,280
scoped for a project

2268
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,159
so for me i would still prefer to use

2269
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,000
event storming also for the user

2270
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,679
perspective because you can model that

2271
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,120
in i can just

2272
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,360
remove for instance events if they would

2273
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,840
like to talk more about

2274
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,400
commands but i can bring in user uh

2275
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,679
the user journey in this journey of

2276
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,880
a event storm um

2277
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,960
so i would still prefer the flexibility

2278
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,320
of event storming and get the whole

2279
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,560
picture straight in an event storm from

2280
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,199
user journey to and and it might you

2281
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:08,080
might put them

2282
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,159
on top of each other right so you put

2283
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,080
the top one you do then the

2284
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,080
the the user journey and on the bottom

2285
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,199
side you do the

2286
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:18,960
business journey sort of say

2287
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,159
okay that's how i approach it but a

2288
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,360
a i don't think user story mapping would

2289
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:25,760
work

2290
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:30,000
to because it looks more of a problem

2291
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,719
space

2292
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,199
and not yet in the solution space so it

2293
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:34,000
looks of

2294
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,159
what's the problem of a user what's the

2295
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:39,120
user story so that's still problem space

2296
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,520
and then the way you implement that in a

2297
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,840
user story map

2298
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,600
then you need something like example

2299
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,360
mapping event storming

2300
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,639
or uh any other technique you wish to go

2301
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,960
towards the solution space or going

2302
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,280
inside the solution space

2303
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:59,679
yeah great i'll answer your question

2304
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:03,199
yeah pretty much good all right sorry

2305
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,520
for that um

2306
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,520
should we take a quick vote to see who

2307
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,199
wants to do hands-on modeling versus

2308
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:10,639
continuing the discussion

2309
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,880
i think we've got about 40 minutes left

2310
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,480
which is just enough time

2311
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,480
but it seems like there's a lot of uh do

2312
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:19,920
we have many questions left still

2313
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,520
yeah there's uh some comments

2314
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,199
or this it's a question there's three

2315
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:30,639
questions i see

2316
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,040
uh two question the one is about leaving

2317
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:33,920
so

2318
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,800
two questions left

2319
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:41,760
so shall we do a vote so is that

2320
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,679
sometimes it shows the hands and

2321
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,360
sometimes not right oh there's the

2322
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,639
reaction

2323
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,280
so uh thumbs up for continuing the

2324
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,159
conversation then

2325
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:55,040
it's on the bottom you see reactions and

2326
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,560
just do a thumbs up

2327
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,000
to continuously conversation and a

2328
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,080
clap for doing modeling

2329
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,880
so i see now

2330
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:14,400
six for modeling and

2331
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,840
seven eight i think most people are

2332
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:22,840
into for the modeling nick all right

2333
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,120
cool

2334
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,440
so let's do that yeah i guess we i guess

2335
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,480
we can do both

2336
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:32,080
so i'll create some spaces on the mirror

2337
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,679
board

2338
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,760
and then if the people who want to do

2339
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,440
modeling can put their hands back up

2340
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:41,120
we'll put you into breakout groups

2341
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,800
yeah i'm not sure if you can you need to

2342
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,320
do it on the right side

2343
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,239
right where there's more and then put

2344
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,000
your hands up so

2345
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,920
let's see one person putting their hands

2346
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,440
on for the modeling space

2347
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,120
so do it in the chat you can put your

2348
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,719
hands up so if you put your hands up

2349
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:57,440
here

2350
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:01,920
i'll throw you in a in a group

2351
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,520
to do modeling and then we might stay

2352
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,080
here and

2353
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,719
continue to or we could we could do some

2354
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:12,480
mob modeling

2355
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,320
we could just try doing it as a mob

2356
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,639
doing everything by votes

2357
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:19,120
yeah because i still see only one person

2358
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,239
put their hands up

2359
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:23,040
on the chat so

2360
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,159
all right let's let's do the questions

2361
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,080
and then let's do some

2362
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,840
mob modeling so i see

2363
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,840
three people now with our hands up

2364
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,480
mob modelling sounds neat too

2365
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,679
i'd be okay with modeling too okay let's

2366
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,639
do that then

2367
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,639
all right so let's do uh let's do mob

2368
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:51,920
modeling then we'll come back to the

2369
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:52,960
questions

2370
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,159
in say half an hour

2371
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:59,199
yeah so kevin will finish we'll finish

2372
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,840
around half past

2373
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,560
sounds good so kenny you had a domain

2374
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,840
you were talking about before

2375
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,320
would you like to be the domain expert

2376
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,520
yeah sure

2377
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,760
yeah it's one of my favorite things

2378
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,679
about a car

2379
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,000
all right so i'll be the facilitator or

2380
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,960
the driver

2381
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,760
for the first five minutes

2382
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,000
and then we'll switch so tell me about

2383
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,600
this domain what what's this domain

2384
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,960
called

2385
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,440
so it's uh it's the adaptive cruise

2386
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,000
control

2387
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,199
for a car adaptive cruise control for a

2388
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:34,320
car okay

2389
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,639
yeah so you have self-driving cars from

2390
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,080
tesla now of course

2391
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:42,239
but uh before that um my theme

2392
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:44,639
i i've been riding this for three years

2393
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,360
a adaptive cruise control car so

2394
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:52,159
what it mostly does is look

2395
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,719
there's a few functions so it looks in

2396
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:55,280
front

2397
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,199
and just mimics the speed of the person

2398
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:02,080
in front so you put it on like cruise

2399
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,280
control saying

2400
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,679
okay i want to drive 100 kilometers an

2401
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:07,760
hour and then it just drives and as soon

2402
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,520
as there's a

2403
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,960
purse a car in front it will

2404
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,480
stay on a safe distance and adapt to the

2405
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,199
cruising of the person in front that's

2406
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:19,520
the

2407
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,719
main that's the main functionality

2408
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:24,239
there's more but that's the main one

2409
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:25,600
what would we like to model here let's

2410
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,000
let's

2411
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,880
think about the scope are we modeling a

2412
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:29,360
short

2413
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,080
simple transaction or would we like to

2414
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:32,719
model

2415
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,320
a longer flow what do you think

2416
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,679
what's that what's the scope from your

2417
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:39,679
perspective we're modeling the

2418
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,000
the whole thing well there are several

2419
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,320
actions a user can take

2420
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,320
right there's several actions that can

2421
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,760
happen and that we need to take in

2422
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,600
account for

2423
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,120
okay so i don't think it's a fool

2424
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,480
i can explain the journey and maybe we

2425
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,880
can map that out and then

2426
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,480
dissect these specific functions

2427
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:07,040
okay yes let's map the user journey

2428
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,400
with just just uh post-its

2429
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,159
to start with let's get the user journey

2430
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:14,159
straight

2431
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:17,440
so can you see can you see my screen

2432
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,280
okay

2433
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,520
yeah so what's the first thing what's

2434
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,679
this let's firstly what's this scenario

2435
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:24,159
we're

2436
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:27,760
modeling here so the scenario the first

2437
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:28,560
scenarios

2438
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,360
is um

2439
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,639
setting the cruise control setting the

2440
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,400
cruise control perfect i don't like

2441
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:36,960
setting

2442
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,199
but but uh yeah

2443
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,920
okay we'll put stars around that maybe

2444
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,120
we can find them still need to think

2445
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,719
about the word setting because i don't

2446
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:50,239
like technical terms in my domain sure

2447
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:52,400
yeah so what stuff what's the first

2448
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,800
thing the user does

2449
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,600
the first thing is sorry who is the user

2450
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,520
tell me a bit about the user

2451
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,719
the user is the driver of a car

2452
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,639
anything more specific about this user

2453
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,239
that you can tell us is it a driver of

2454
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:06,880
any car

2455
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,639
is it a particular demographic or

2456
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,639
particular customer segment or

2457
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:13,760
luxury car or no no it's it's

2458
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,199
uh so the early ones uh are

2459
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,679
so so let's take a cruise control car

2460
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:20,960
because that's the

2461
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,000
most fun to watch yeah all right so

2462
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,040
let's take a

2463
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,000
electric vehicle crew uh electric

2464
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,960
vehicle

2465
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:31,920
car driver electric but it doesn't yeah

2466
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,120
it doesn't need to be in the higher

2467
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,080
segments though

2468
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,080
because this dire segment is a tesla

2469
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,080
which is a self-driving car so it's it's

2470
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:38,719
a

2471
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,600
it's the the mid to low range cars

2472
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,080
drivers

2473
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:46,080
is is this a commercial driver or a

2474
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:50,080
business not a commercial driver like

2475
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:53,679
sorry leisure is it like a leisure park

2476
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,280
commuting or yeah okay

2477
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,320
commuting great so the first thing they

2478
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:00,639
do

2479
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,960
is

2480
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:13,199
so the first thing would be to

2481
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:16,400
set the speed of the cruise control

2482
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:20,400
so the speed of the cues control um

2483
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,159
how do you how do you say that english

2484
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,480
word

2485
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:28,960
cruise control

2486
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,760
yes that sounds okay now we can fix it

2487
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,480
later

2488
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,520
yeah and then

2489
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,480
and then depending on on the current

2490
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,440
speed of the car

2491
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,360
let's go for the happy scenario that

2492
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,520
there's no other car around

2493
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,560
it will adjust the speed of the car to

2494
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,520
the set

2495
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,719
speed of the cruise control

2496
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:57,440
so i'm going to put a placeholder here

2497
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,639
other cars around

2498
01:35:58,639 --> 01:35:59,920
we'll come back to that later and the

2499
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,239
happy path is

2500
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:07,840
uh so so in this first one

2501
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,480
cruise control speed sets and in this

2502
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,639
one

2503
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:16,159
uh this one is the car car speed

2504
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:19,520
uh crash speeds adjusted to cruise

2505
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,639
control what are you saying

2506
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:25,840
yeah to cruise control speed

2507
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:31,679
okay so my time mobbing is up we'll pick

2508
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:32,480
another person

2509
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,400
next let's just have a very quick

2510
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,440
retrospective so

2511
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,639
i think this is going in the right

2512
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,159
direction let's think about the use of

2513
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:42,000
journey before the bound of context

2514
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,920
but my concern is all the people who are

2515
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:46,560
not

2516
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:50,159
driving or facilita or the domain expert

2517
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:51,280
what are they supposed to be doing right

2518
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,880
now can they do anything or is it just

2519
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,679
passive watching

2520
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,719
so i i have a proposal which is

2521
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,480
if you're watching you're allowed to

2522
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:07,040
raise a question using this green one

2523
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,880
so yeah if you're if you're not

2524
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,600
the driver or the domain expert you can

2525
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,280
put one of these green stickers up as a

2526
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,320
question

2527
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,000
and then when the session finishes we'll

2528
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,080
review the questions how does that sound

2529
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:25,920
yeah all right so now we need to select

2530
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,119
a new driver my time is over

2531
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:35,840
any volunteers

2532
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,880
there were a few right we wanted to do

2533
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:39,760
so anyone

2534
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:49,840
who wants to volunteer

2535
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,560
if you can unmute yourself and start

2536
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,440
talking if you want

2537
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,560
how about you savas you feel a bit of

2538
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:05,199
driving

2539
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:08,400
a bit of mobbing uh

2540
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,880
sorry i i don't i don't think i'll uh i

2541
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:11,679
don't know actually

2542
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:14,480
i think i need to drop off to be honest

2543
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,000
no worries

2544
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,520
i'll try to stick around i don't know

2545
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,600
but i'll uh i don't think i can

2546
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,880
enjoy it now sorry

2547
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,360
no problem so maybe we'll just continue

2548
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,320
then make or not

2549
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,920
okay i'll do another five minutes and

2550
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,400
then if anyone wants to take over

2551
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,239
just put a chat put a message in chat

2552
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,159
and you can take over okay

2553
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,960
yep right so don't forget if you're

2554
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,400
watching you can add questions

2555
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,560
so we've the car itself has adjusted to

2556
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,719
the cruise control speed

2557
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:50,159
and what happens next well that that is

2558
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:52,960
that's the happy scenario and eventually

2559
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:53,679
you'll just

2560
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,119
uh eventually you'll end up breaking

2561
01:38:57,119 --> 01:39:00,400
so you you press the brake or

2562
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:03,920
you uh lose the cruise control set

2563
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,159
and then you've ended so either you

2564
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:07,440
brake

2565
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,360
and then it uh the cruise control will

2566
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,880
get off

2567
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,080
or uh you put it off yourself

2568
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,280
manually okay so we've got two scenarios

2569
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:17,600
here

2570
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,360
which is yeah two things can happen

2571
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,840
at this point but maybe uh that's the

2572
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,600
end and then we might go into the next

2573
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,400
scenario

2574
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,920
and that's the third event that can

2575
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,440
happen

2576
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,760
uh there's actually four things that can

2577
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,840
happen now

2578
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,880
so the driver can break yeah

2579
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,960
you can manually end cruise control so

2580
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,679
the user ended the cruise control

2581
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,119
user ended cruise control

2582
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,320
cool and there was another one you were

2583
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,400
saying yeah so this this will just

2584
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,520
end the cruise control thing right uh

2585
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,080
and there's um there's

2586
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,760
well there's an emergency brake function

2587
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,000
uh that that will end the right as well

2588
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,159
so that's an easy one and there's a

2589
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:13,600
third one

2590
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,800
so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna start

2591
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,560
spreading these out what do you think

2592
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,320
about this so

2593
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:26,480
emergency brake activated

2594
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,040
yeah that will just that will just uh

2595
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:29,520
end

2596
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,679
the the that will just end it as well

2597
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:35,760
there's a few scenarios now that will

2598
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,280
move into a next

2599
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:41,840
uh next scenario at this point

2600
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:46,000
okay um which one of these

2601
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,080
is the main flow from here do you feel

2602
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,440
like any one of these

2603
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,080
is no this will end the flow so there's

2604
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,280
the fourth one

2605
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,880
is a car is drive a

2606
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:04,800
car detected in front

2607
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,119
okay

2608
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:14,080
so these are the four possible things

2609
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,560
that can happen here

2610
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,360
uh there there are multiple there's

2611
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,280
actually another architecture in france

2612
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,040
is that this one here are the cards

2613
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,360
around or yeah that's that one

2614
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:29,360
so but it's it's mostly in front

2615
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,520
okay so someone in youtube

2616
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,920
jimmy and youtube says usually verb is

2617
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,440
cancel for ending cruise control

2618
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,920
manually

2619
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,639
user cancels cruise control that's also

2620
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:43,760
a

2621
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,400
nice one but maybe ended this but car

2622
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,960
detected in front is other cars around

2623
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,760
because it's mostly about the one in

2624
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,400
front of you

2625
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,080
so what might be the word here

2626
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:01,440
cars detected nearby

2627
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,440
or slower because it's about a car

2628
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,040
that's driving slower right

2629
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:09,440
slower cars detected nearby yeah

2630
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,880
okay so this is it these are the four

2631
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,719
scenarios here

2632
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:17,760
uh yeah we might yeah

2633
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,480
i think so as well for now maybe we'll

2634
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,520
figure more out later

2635
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:28,239
all right so there's a lot of complexity

2636
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,320
we could jump into here

2637
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:34,400
but for the purpose of this workshop

2638
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,800
i think we should uh move to the

2639
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,080
boundary context

2640
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,400
let's let's jump into the solution space

2641
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,119
now

2642
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:42,400
and we can come back to the problem

2643
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:45,520
space if needed

2644
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:50,639
yep okay

2645
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,119
so i'm looking at the problem space we

2646
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:54,639
don't have a lot of complexity in the

2647
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:56,880
domain here

2648
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:01,280
um i i'm leaning towards

2649
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:05,280
creating maybe just a

2650
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:09,440
a message flow diagram here like this

2651
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,719
because it seems like it should be

2652
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:14,639
simple yeah

2653
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:19,920
yeah either that or the or the uml one

2654
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,840
yeah i would go for this one because i

2655
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,679
think because yours is based on

2656
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:28,320
a domain storytelling right this flow

2657
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:28,719
yeah

2658
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,480
based on it yeah exactly based on the

2659
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:31,920
main storytelling

2660
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,920
and it reminds me a bit about the uml uh

2661
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,679
diagrams but then in a more domainy way

2662
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:43,520
and in a more flexible way right

2663
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:46,960
so i i i enjoyed that one

2664
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,239
for these kind of cases

2665
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,520
because event storming is really and

2666
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,520
that that's that's the case i was making

2667
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:55,840
right

2668
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,920
event storming is a flow which you go

2669
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,280
through from left to right

2670
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,119
and you're already seeing that there's a

2671
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:03,199
lot happening at one point

2672
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:05,840
so then something like this would would

2673
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,239
uh

2674
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:09,199
help me more i think yeah so my my

2675
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:10,800
heuristic here is

2676
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,920
there's not much flow here there's not a

2677
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:14,560
long seat

2678
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,000
there's not a long conversation

2679
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,360
involving lots of back and forth

2680
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,760
communication

2681
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,760
it seems like this can summarize

2682
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,880
everything

2683
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,119
hopefully we'll discover that this

2684
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:26,960
doesn't summarize things

2685
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,239
and we'll realize we'll have to jump

2686
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:31,440
back into the problem space

2687
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:42,000
yeah yeah um so as a beginner i

2688
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,679
i'm just um trying to get my bearings

2689
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:48,480
here is what you did in

2690
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,480
excuse me when you were exploring the

2691
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,320
problem space

2692
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,800
um i think you were calling that the

2693
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:55,760
user

2694
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,119
journey correct yeah that's it

2695
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:02,320
and is that sort of a

2696
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:05,360
simplistic uh events storm

2697
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,840
that you just that you used for that or

2698
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,639
is that

2699
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:10,800
unrelated to the windstorming technique

2700
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:11,679
it seems like it

2701
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,840
those are event events in the orange

2702
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:14,719
right

2703
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:16,639
yeah very high level events in the

2704
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:18,159
domain

2705
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:20,800
yeah so it's it's that this technique is

2706
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,159
a bit similar as you would

2707
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:24,159
probably might also do and use story

2708
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:25,600
mapping for instance right

2709
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,480
you start with either commands or events

2710
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,800
i like events more

2711
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,639
but yeah this is how i usually start

2712
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:35,040
well if you only have one domain expert

2713
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:35,920
this is

2714
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,480
that's the heuristic i think christina

2715
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,920
made up as well and it's

2716
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,760
also from user story mapping right if

2717
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,840
you only have one domain expert

2718
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,000
don't let the domain expert speak and

2719
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,080
you just map out these events what you

2720
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:48,719
hear

2721
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:50,880
and at some point what nick is now doing

2722
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,000
oh maybe this

2723
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,360
helps more let's do it

2724
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:59,199
does that make sense does that answer

2725
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:01,600
your question

2726
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,639
yeah i got you thank you

2727
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:07,520
and that's why i believe if you have

2728
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,159
this toolbox right

2729
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:13,840
niket you wanted to say something or not

2730
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:17,600
i'm i'm not hearing you correctly

2731
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:21,679
unfortunately is that only for me

2732
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:26,880
yeah i don't hear sound either no your

2733
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,520
sound is

2734
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,520
robotically maybe right

2735
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:35,199
in chat if you can so

2736
01:46:35,199 --> 01:46:39,199
what i was about to say um

2737
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:42,480
is um i don't believe in in

2738
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,840
one one two i believe you should pick

2739
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,159
the tool that comes in you just

2740
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:50,639
i like to start with event storming and

2741
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,639
as we did now

2742
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:55,520
just with events laying them down and

2743
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,280
then when you get the experience you'll

2744
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:57,920
notice

2745
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,760
maybe i need example mapping now maybe i

2746
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,320
need uh this flow modeling right now

2747
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:03,760
maybe i need

2748
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:06,000
uh big picture event storming or worldly

2749
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,600
mapping that there's the whole toolbox

2750
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,040
that you can use and

2751
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:12,480
pick one uh start exploring

2752
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,880
my advice will also be always start with

2753
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,560
always learn event storming because it

2754
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,199
has the

2755
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:19,920
best hit ratio but as you can see here

2756
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,760
it won't help you at this

2757
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,280
certain modeling

2758
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,719
and then you just switch to the other

2759
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:29,679
one just try out as many as you can

2760
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:32,000
experiment with them and see what fits

2761
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,679
you the most and the best

2762
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,719
that's the most interesting part hey

2763
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:39,520
am i am i audible now properly yeah yeah

2764
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,080
yeah

2765
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,560
so uh one thing i want to know that can

2766
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:43,119
i

2767
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:45,199
uh i mean can i duplicate the events

2768
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:46,960
over here for example

2769
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:51,040
uh when slower car detected nearby

2770
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:54,880
it is also possible that afterwards uh

2771
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,560
we need to under the cruise control or

2772
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,719
something like that or it will actually

2773
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,560
you know i mean increase the complexity

2774
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,840
of the system

2775
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:05,440
so yeah so i have a heuristic which is

2776
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,199
whenever you see the same event

2777
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:09,440
which can happen in multiple places

2778
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,520
always qualify it

2779
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:14,800
so for me uh i would have

2780
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,320
here cruise control ended

2781
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:22,000
due to slower cars cruise control ended

2782
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,679
due to journey ending and then

2783
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:27,760
we might find a better name for those

2784
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:28,719
like

2785
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:31,600
cruise control ended because we detected

2786
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,000
slower cars nearby that might be

2787
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,560
cruise control shut off or something

2788
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,639
there might be a special name for it

2789
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,480
like oh yeah when we end the cruise

2790
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,560
control because there's a car nearby

2791
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,400
that might be called a a dam a collision

2792
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:49,440
collision prevented or something like

2793
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,360
that

2794
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,159
okay so yeah i would always duplicate it

2795
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:56,000
and then look to try and qualify it

2796
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,840
and then find a better name for each

2797
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:01,840
event

2798
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:06,719
duplicating

2799
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:10,960
i actually had a small question if you

2800
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,080
don't mind

2801
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:15,520
so uh we should consider this one

2802
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:18,960
is like a very small but

2803
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,560
big picture event storming right

2804
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,239
yeah i guess it it really depends on the

2805
01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:29,679
scope of the workshop

2806
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:33,520
but looking at these events

2807
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:36,400
i think there's probably a lot of stuff

2808
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:40,000
going on in here that we haven't modeled

2809
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:44,960
so cruise control speed sets

2810
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,960
there's there's a bunch of stuff going

2811
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,880
on there inside the system to

2812
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:54,880
set the speed like these events here are

2813
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,040
mostly just like the user-facing thing

2814
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,880
things that the user sees

2815
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,880
but when you when you set the cruise

2816
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,040
control

2817
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,000
that needs to

2818
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:08,560
control some internal electronics are we

2819
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,480
modeling that here or is that outside of

2820
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,960
the scope

2821
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:19,199
right right here it's probably outside

2822
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,599
of scope

2823
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:27,199
probably for this one yeah but

2824
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:30,639
maybe there are other scenarios i mean

2825
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:31,599
all of them

2826
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:34,239
looks like something that the user will

2827
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:35,040
notice

2828
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:38,239
or face like whether the car speed was

2829
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:39,119
adjusted

2830
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:41,599
or the emergence emergency brake was

2831
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:43,040
activated right

2832
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,840
yeah and uh what what we're lacking here

2833
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,280
is a couple of things

2834
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:50,400
so why is the user setting the speed

2835
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,360
control

2836
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:53,840
that could be important that might give

2837
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,679
us different insights

2838
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:58,800
and what are they setting the speed to

2839
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,880
and what is the current state of the

2840
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,560
world so

2841
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,320
it might be user is setting cruise

2842
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,920
control because they just got on the

2843
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,119
motorway

2844
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:12,159
and they're setting it to the maximum

2845
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:13,440
motorway speed limit

2846
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,880
ah okay we've got like oh sorry um

2847
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,440
the motorway in the uk is like the what

2848
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,080
do you call it

2849
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:21,920
like the fastest road you the biggest

2850
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,280
roads

2851
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,639
where you can drive the fastest with

2852
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:26,880
three lanes let's say

2853
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:29,760
but maybe there's another reason for

2854
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,040
setting the speed control

2855
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:34,159
maybe it's on a smaller road for example

2856
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:36,880
and they're setting it to a lower speed

2857
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,280
and

2858
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:43,119
maybe maybe it's like

2859
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:46,320
first time user setting speed control

2860
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:49,360
the first time user setting the um

2861
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,040
cruise control speed

2862
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,719
like all of these different regions for

2863
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:54,239
doing this might yield different

2864
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:55,119
insights

2865
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:56,560
and have different events that come

2866
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,880
after it so to me this is like

2867
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,639
super high level this is about as high

2868
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:02,639
level as you can get really

2869
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:05,679
there's a lot of stuff going on in here

2870
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:07,520
like what was the user doing before they

2871
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:10,000
did this

2872
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:16,320
so yeah super high level i would say

2873
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:19,440
so i actually wanted to continue with

2874
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:22,639
asking whether we can just

2875
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:26,239
try to use other event storm types

2876
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:28,400
like the designer event storming or

2877
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,719
value an event storm in

2878
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:35,360
to instead of using some other technique

2879
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:38,880
here to model them commands

2880
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:41,760
i don't know aggregates projections etc

2881
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:42,239
yes

2882
01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:44,639
okay let's do that let's do the next

2883
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:46,159
five minutes of mobbing we'll try and

2884
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:49,280
use event storming here

2885
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,960
it was just a question but okay actually

2886
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,800
let's let's do five more minutes on this

2887
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,480
technique and finish this one

2888
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,080
and then we'll compare by doing five

2889
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,840
minutes on the event storming to have

2890
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,280
two things to compare

2891
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:06,320
how's that sound yeah sounds great

2892
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,920
okay kenny so when when the ev driver or

2893
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:12,480
the commuter i put here when they set

2894
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,760
the cruise control

2895
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,679
uh what what system do they talk to is

2896
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:17,280
there like a ui in the car like a

2897
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:19,040
cruiser yeah it's it's a physical

2898
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:22,880
it's a physical on your on your steering

2899
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:23,440
wheel

2900
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:24,960
there are some buttons on your steering

2901
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,560
wheel okay

2902
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,800
um

2903
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:33,679
so steer wheel buttons or something

2904
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:35,360
yeah okay steering wheel button let's go

2905
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,960
with that yeah or

2906
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:41,840
uh oh you see it

2907
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,239
yeah that's that's fine we switch or

2908
01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:48,639
something

2909
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:51,520
sorry maybe a switch or something isn't

2910
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:52,480
it called a switch

2911
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:54,800
like we put out the new ones you just

2912
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,400
have buttons where you say

2913
01:53:56,400 --> 01:54:00,560
on or off or okay my account

2914
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:03,280
there's some there's some form of uh

2915
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,239
just like a

2916
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:06,400
playstation 4 controller or a switch

2917
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:07,280
controller right

2918
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:12,000
something like that a joy joy joy

2919
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,280
so does the user specify the speed here

2920
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:18,400
or how is the speed worked out so the

2921
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,440
speed

2922
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:23,840
you set based on your current speed

2923
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:28,639
and then you can adjust it okay so

2924
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:31,760
we have the current speed plus

2925
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,280
uh an adjustment let's say yeah

2926
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:38,719
you might also set it by our voice

2927
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:42,719
oh yeah i never tried that liking

2928
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:44,960
okay

2929
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:49,679
voice control let's put that for now so

2930
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:51,119
okay where's typically

2931
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:54,719
would just um push a button

2932
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:56,880
um but i would say the future you might

2933
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,080
just say

2934
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:01,760
um hey car put me to 100 kilometers

2935
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,719
or maybe put me to max speed or you

2936
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:06,400
don't know you didn't see it but you cut

2937
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,000
it and you just say

2938
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,320
um go the fastest as possible

2939
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:18,159
just throwing ideas here so then uh

2940
01:55:18,159 --> 01:55:22,000
this control unit inside the car

2941
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,159
this just takes the information from the

2942
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:26,719
user it's just the interface at this

2943
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:28,239
point it doesn't contain any business

2944
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:29,840
rules or logic

2945
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,960
then we have some kind of we have some

2946
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,800
kind of custom code to process this

2947
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:37,360
request

2948
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,320
so this is our first bound of context

2949
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:43,199
what do we call this

2950
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,000
uh

2951
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,560
bonus contacts would would be uh well

2952
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:49,520
let's just call it

2953
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:53,360
uh the cruise control surface

2954
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,040
cruise control service sounds a bit

2955
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:56,960
generic but let's go

2956
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,760
let's go with that we can if this this

2957
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,280
technique will show us if it's doing too

2958
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:02,639
many things

2959
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:06,960
yeah i it probably is for now but

2960
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:14,560
yeah okay

2961
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,360
so then basically the ui is basically

2962
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:20,000
just forwarding that command right

2963
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,520
it's just forwarding what the user's

2964
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,840
done to the to the actual business logic

2965
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,159
here now i um

2966
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:30,480
yeah eventually it will send probably uh

2967
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:31,280
to to the

2968
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:34,480
uh i think to a system

2969
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:37,760
called the engine i guess right yeah it

2970
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,599
needs to control

2971
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:42,800
the engine okay

2972
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:46,239
let's say engine engine management

2973
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:48,880
engine service something generic engine

2974
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,560
engine service for now

2975
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,239
electrical engine yeah something like

2976
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:53,679
that all right let's okay

2977
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:57,840
so what what's going on in here then

2978
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,280
is this another command here

2979
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:08,400
and the other one is set

2980
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:12,800
adjust speed i guess okay so the

2981
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,560
the engine service knows nothing about

2982
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,320
cruise control right

2983
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:20,320
no no so it just it just wants to

2984
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:23,679
adjust speed adjust speed

2985
01:57:23,679 --> 01:57:25,599
and in here we just have the new speed i

2986
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:27,520
guess

2987
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:30,080
uh yeah

2988
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:35,199
speed so now now becomes the interesting

2989
01:57:35,199 --> 01:57:36,960
question right so

2990
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,119
normally the engine surface will also

2991
01:57:39,119 --> 01:57:40,080
react on my

2992
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:43,440
uh on my gas pedal in this case

2993
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,599
maybe the the engine service would

2994
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:48,239
accelerate

2995
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:52,800
yeah would it be so i i would guess

2996
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,719
because with an electrical

2997
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:57,760
would it accelerate or will you just

2998
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:01,119
uh pre say to the engine surface but now

2999
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:02,239
we're going to get into

3000
01:58:02,239 --> 01:58:05,040
god class or not right well you say to

3001
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:06,639
the engine surface

3002
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:09,920
uh go to go to this speed

3003
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,480
or would you say okay increase speed and

3004
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,159
then when it doesn't have to increase

3005
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:15,599
speed anymore you just say

3006
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:18,320
no not increase speed so feedback loop

3007
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:19,440
kind of thing right i mean

3008
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,960
what you're saying is that i mean it

3009
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:23,280
depends on if if the cruise control

3010
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:23,920
service

3011
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,960
says uh something um

3012
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:29,440
it might be different um but the

3013
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:31,280
adjustment of speed might be

3014
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:33,520
different let's say quota quote faster

3015
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:34,639
or slower

3016
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:37,679
than if you would um push a pedal with

3017
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,040
your feet

3018
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,520
right if you want to go really fast up

3019
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:42,800
to a certain speed

3020
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,880
and then you would accelerate faster

3021
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:45,920
maybe that's too

3022
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:48,719
deep here but just wanted to mention it

3023
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:50,080
oh that's some interesting

3024
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:52,159
nikket you wanted to say something so

3025
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:54,320
i'm so yeah i mean i'm saying that

3026
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,480
uh basically the idea of cruise control

3027
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,080
service making sense if

3028
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:01,360
uh if it takes a decision

3029
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,119
uh i mean you know what i'm trying to

3030
01:59:03,119 --> 01:59:04,960
say if if we are just

3031
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:07,440
sending a command to adjust speed to

3032
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:08,880
particular number

3033
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:11,280
to engine service directly then

3034
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,400
potentially

3035
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,159
service control and cruise control

3036
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:16,639
service doesn't have the you know

3037
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:18,239
i mean control so what i'm trying to say

3038
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:19,920
engine service should have increase or

3039
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:20,960
decrease kind of

3040
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:24,000
commands i mean handle the command of

3041
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,159
increase the speed or decrease the speed

3042
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:28,480
and then it will also

3043
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,400
notify the you know current speed to the

3044
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,159
cruise control service

3045
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:35,199
and cruise control service should do the

3046
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:37,760
uh speed adjustment i mean by by

3047
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,800
adjusting the commands continuously

3048
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,119
don't we have a race condition there

3049
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:44,239
like if the control

3050
01:59:44,239 --> 01:59:46,560
if the if the cruise control says the

3051
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:48,320
current speed's 50

3052
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:51,920
i want to get to 70 increase it by 20

3053
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:55,599
but in the time frame between the contr

3054
01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:56,080
the

3055
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:59,040
cruise control doing that and the

3056
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:00,400
message being received by the engine

3057
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,560
service the user puts their foot down

3058
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,199
and the user's going to 70 the engine

3059
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:07,520
will now say oh i'm at 70

3060
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:10,840
the cruise control is asking me to go to

3061
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:13,040
90.

3062
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,520
yeah my question is that when when uh

3063
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:16,080
person

3064
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,320
uh put the pedal at that time uh the

3065
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,920
event which was there that you know

3066
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:20,560
means the

3067
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:23,520
the loop will be sorry just a second the

3068
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:24,320
isn't it

3069
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,560
it is as good as user ended the cruise

3070
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,119
control i mean i'm just asking

3071
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:31,920
so if we put cruise control afterwards

3072
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:32,320
can

3073
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:36,719
user uh put the pedal or if he puts that

3074
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:38,800
uh isn't it the you know means that the

3075
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,000
uh it is as good as

3076
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,280
uh cruise control is ended asking

3077
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:46,960
kenny i mean uh

3078
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,840
yeah so so does putting the foot down

3079
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:51,760
deactivate the cruise control good

3080
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:52,320
question

3081
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:54,639
so so here here we're coming into the

3082
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:56,480
the solution space right

3083
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:58,080
yeah i would say if you put the foot

3084
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,840
down on the brake it

3085
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,800
yes it cancels cruise control but if you

3086
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:03,840
accelerate

3087
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:07,520
it kind of just overrides i mean that

3088
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:09,520
at least that's what i experienced in in

3089
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:10,719
cars

3090
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:13,840
okay uh until i see me as a user i i

3091
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:14,719
don't care

3092
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:18,320
i just wanted at that cruise speed

3093
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:21,119
and the rest i don't care about right

3094
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:22,239
that that's my

3095
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:24,719
user perception so how it does it i'm i

3096
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:25,760
don't care

3097
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:28,560
now typically but let's imagine you're

3098
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:28,960
at

3099
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:32,639
at 50 you're entering the the motor road

3100
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:36,320
and you said or go to 100 and it does it

3101
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:38,320
like the acceleration let's say in a

3102
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:39,360
relaxed way

3103
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:41,119
in a relaxed fashion but then you

3104
02:01:41,119 --> 02:01:43,119
realize oh there's someone

3105
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:46,239
um very fast approaching behind me and i

3106
02:01:46,239 --> 02:01:48,400
need to speed up very quickly

3107
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:51,760
then you push your foot on the pedal

3108
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:54,880
just to go faster to the 100 to

3109
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:57,599
to exit this dangerous situation then

3110
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:58,320
you lift it

3111
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:01,360
again and still cruise control is on

3112
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,880
should be on because that's what you

3113
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:03,599
used to

3114
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:05,599
from tubing cruise control systems when

3115
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:08,080
the low mid range yeah so you can

3116
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:10,880
you can always go faster i can put my

3117
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:11,679
foot down

3118
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:14,159
and i can go faster than the set cruise

3119
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,480
control

3120
02:02:17,199 --> 02:02:18,880
like the acceleration that was

3121
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:20,239
anticipated by the

3122
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:22,719
cruise control service yeah yeah so it

3123
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:24,960
will just do a basic acceleration but i

3124
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,040
can put my gas on the pedal and i can go

3125
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:28,159
faster

3126
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:30,800
so there's there's this other other

3127
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:31,199
thing

3128
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:34,000
that the ev commuter can do and that's

3129
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,199
use the paddle

3130
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:37,760
and also control the engine surface and

3131
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,639
yeah that's just

3132
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:42,000
what i wanted to say maybe yeah

3133
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,800
maybe the warning adjusts speed maybe

3134
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:45,440
it's not

3135
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:48,719
um as good as um actually cruise control

3136
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:49,840
would really it would say

3137
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:52,960
accelerate in a certain fashion and

3138
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,719
um a different system let's say that the

3139
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:56,080
foot pedal would also say

3140
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:59,280
accelerate in a in a specific

3141
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:02,400
way like accelerate faster or

3142
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:03,679
it might be different but the engine

3143
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:06,000
service would just take in okay how

3144
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,760
how much how fast should i accelerate or

3145
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:13,280
effectively how much gas do i put in

3146
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:15,119
the cylinders to burn or something

3147
02:03:15,119 --> 02:03:16,560
because that results in a certain

3148
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:18,800
acceleration

3149
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,239
so the question is isn't it the

3150
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:22,719
acceleration that the engine service

3151
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:24,320
accepts instead of

3152
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:26,639
go to a different speed because how is

3153
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:28,960
the engine service supposed to know

3154
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:31,360
what acceleration to go to that set

3155
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:33,599
speed

3156
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:41,280
so i'm just nick adding the other one

3157
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:42,400
here as well

3158
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,560
to make it a bit more clear perhaps

3159
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:46,400
something a little bit more expensive

3160
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:48,639
so you have the speed pedal that also

3161
02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:50,639
controls the engine surface right that

3162
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:52,400
should be separate or not

3163
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,840
that's what you're saying as well

3164
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:55,760
andreas and you can get

3165
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:59,040
both of you yeah exactly so yeah it's a

3166
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:00,400
good question now

3167
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:03,440
so does the engine service have an open

3168
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:05,119
host service

3169
02:04:05,119 --> 02:04:09,040
which is a standard interface

3170
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:11,440
which both of those things use so are

3171
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:12,560
they both calling

3172
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:15,040
let's say

3173
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:18,639
the question is is it is it drive by a

3174
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:21,520
wire so to say

3175
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:24,000
i mean it's not a physical wire anymore

3176
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,440
it's it's all just

3177
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:29,280
commands right and like received by

3178
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:32,639
uh engine electronics these days whereas

3179
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:33,679
back then it was

3180
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:36,159
really a physical cable that that you

3181
02:04:36,159 --> 02:04:36,800
adjusted

3182
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:40,639
the gas that was put into the motor

3183
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:47,440
so i have one question uh you said that

3184
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:48,400
i mean the cruise

3185
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:51,679
cruise control limit was 100 kilometer

3186
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:55,280
now uh you know means uh driver actually

3187
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:58,960
use the pedal and it goes to 120

3188
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:02,400
via manual uh speed pedal yeah so after

3189
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:05,520
afterwards uh after you know eventually

3190
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:08,560
it will be down to uh

3191
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:11,679
100 because cruise control was 100

3192
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:14,880
or once that limit will be cross

3193
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,199
it will be higher only i mean you know

3194
02:05:17,199 --> 02:05:21,760
120 only

3195
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:24,480
can i quickly go meta here and just put

3196
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:26,560
on my modeling hat so

3197
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:29,760
what i'm seeing here is that

3198
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:32,480
we we modeled out the problem space and

3199
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:34,880
it looked very simple

3200
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,880
we've jumped into the solution space

3201
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:39,599
which forces us to be more precise

3202
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:40,880
thinking about how can we build

3203
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:42,960
something that runs in software

3204
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,560
and suddenly we've uncovered lots of

3205
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:46,320
edge cases

3206
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:49,280
so my feeling here is that with we

3207
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:50,320
should be drifting

3208
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:52,880
more back towards the problem space to

3209
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,719
cover these different flows

3210
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:58,159
so one scenario is puts on cruise

3211
02:05:58,159 --> 02:05:59,679
control

3212
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:02,159
cruise control set but then we have this

3213
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:03,440
other scenario where

3214
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:06,560
can cruise control is activated driver

3215
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:08,320
puts their foot on the pedal

3216
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:11,599
we've got different scenarios here and

3217
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:14,480
that's probably worth modeling these in

3218
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:16,159
the problem space first

3219
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:18,400
and then coming back over to here i

3220
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:19,920
think we're pretty much out of time now

3221
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:20,480
anyway

3222
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:24,800
we've got like 15 minutes left so

3223
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:26,560
yeah i think we can we can stop the

3224
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,880
mobbing um

3225
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:31,520
but they they were good questions and

3226
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:34,560
when we were saying earlier

3227
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:37,599
are these events too high level well

3228
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:39,679
we proved it by jumping to the solution

3229
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:41,119
space that these were

3230
02:06:41,119 --> 02:06:44,239
definitely too high level

3231
02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:46,880
and and this is uh when you when you uh

3232
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:48,239
this relates to

3233
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:51,360
something i always uh use from eric

3234
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:52,159
evans

3235
02:06:52,159 --> 02:06:54,639
it's the modeling whirlpool i'm not sure

3236
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:56,000
if you ever

3237
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,040
ever heard of it i'll put it up the

3238
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:02,079
mirror board put it under the

3239
02:07:02,079 --> 02:07:05,360
under where we were working

3240
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:10,639
so what we just did just for people who

3241
02:07:10,639 --> 02:07:10,960
are

3242
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:14,880
a bit new to to this also always a bit

3243
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:17,040
of my reference as well for

3244
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:19,280
people entering the dvd scene is that

3245
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:21,840
you first what we did was tell a story

3246
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,679
try to be concrete and specific walk

3247
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:26,159
through flesh out refocus on hard part

3248
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:28,079
we focus accordingly forget that now

3249
02:07:28,079 --> 02:07:29,679
that that's not what we did here

3250
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:31,440
but we told the story we tried to be

3251
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:32,800
concrete and precise

3252
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:35,920
right with the scenarios then we went on

3253
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:37,599
proposing a model

3254
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:39,280
and then we gained new insight and what

3255
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:41,199
you're now proposing nick is okay

3256
02:07:41,199 --> 02:07:42,880
maybe we should go back and tell that

3257
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:45,040
story again and that's the whirlpool

3258
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:48,880
uh coming in here i've i've written

3259
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,719
my side of it with event storming

3260
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:52,639
example mapping but there's tons of

3261
02:07:52,639 --> 02:07:53,360
information

3262
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:55,760
going into this uh you can do it with

3263
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:56,960
any

3264
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:00,400
modeling or any any visual tool or

3265
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,079
non-visual tool but this is what

3266
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:04,719
actually for people who are novel or new

3267
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:05,599
to ddd

3268
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:08,079
it's actually a really nice thing that

3269
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:09,520
we're doing we're just

3270
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:11,199
going through scenarios going back and

3271
02:08:11,199 --> 02:08:13,760
forth from problem to solution space

3272
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:16,000
and that's i like about miro by the way

3273
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:16,880
because you just

3274
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:18,960
it's an infinite board you just now you

3275
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:20,800
can just go back

3276
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:23,040
use another scenario underneath and

3277
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,119
propose a new model and you just

3278
02:08:25,119 --> 02:08:27,199
let it be there and delete it later on

3279
02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:30,079
when you don't need it anymore

3280
02:08:30,079 --> 02:08:33,199
it's a lot easier in miro than

3281
02:08:33,199 --> 02:08:35,520
if you do it physically where people

3282
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:38,159
don't tend to duplicate or

3283
02:08:38,159 --> 02:08:40,880
try to uh right it's more sunk cost

3284
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:42,560
fallacy and physical than there is on

3285
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,560
the mirror board

3286
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:50,560
i feel yeah i guess so

3287
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:54,000
yeah definitely i would also say so

3288
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,199
yeah anyways

3289
02:08:57,199 --> 02:08:59,199
you've got 10 minutes left so i guess we

3290
02:08:59,199 --> 02:09:01,119
can return to those questions

3291
02:09:01,119 --> 02:09:05,199
and any other questions

3292
02:09:05,199 --> 02:09:08,560
and then close things out yeah who has

3293
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:09,360
questions

3294
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:12,000
so let's see

3295
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:16,480
i was just going to suggest actually as

3296
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:18,639
well there's another tool um that would

3297
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:20,480
be quite useful here for

3298
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:23,679
um the main message flow which be

3299
02:09:23,679 --> 02:09:26,880
um wps dot d e slash modeler have you

3300
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:27,840
come across that

3301
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:30,840
tool for typically used for domain

3302
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:32,880
storytelling ah yeah the what

3303
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,639
yeah the main storytelling people no

3304
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:37,520
i've not used that at all actually

3305
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:38,880
yeah it's pretty cool i mean uh

3306
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,480
obviously it might be useful for for

3307
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:42,079
this as well because you can upload the

3308
02:09:42,079 --> 02:09:43,440
icons to it as well

3309
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:45,199
and you can do replay so you can

3310
02:09:45,199 --> 02:09:47,360
actually tell the story

3311
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:49,920
in a sequence of interactions that would

3312
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:50,639
be useful

3313
02:09:50,639 --> 02:09:52,079
i guess that can manage some of the

3314
02:09:52,079 --> 02:09:53,440
layout for you as well from the

3315
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:55,280
accidental complexity

3316
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:59,599
yeah i put it here

3317
02:09:59,679 --> 02:10:01,360
i'll put it in the youtube channel as

3318
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:03,119
well so that you've done it wow you've

3319
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:05,520
done it already you beat me to it

3320
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:09,520
cool yeah

3321
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:11,750
a thing here for people is

3322
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:13,119
[Music]

3323
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:16,560
what we started out is also mapping

3324
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:17,920
these tools on a

3325
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,280
lean pub mapping the community tools on

3326
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:23,280
the limp up and we

3327
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:24,960
maybe that's interesting for people as

3328
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:26,400
well

3329
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:29,679
to read up on

3330
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:43,840
so it's the visual collaboration book

3331
02:10:44,719 --> 02:10:46,960
any more questions i think i see a few

3332
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:56,239
more messages

3333
02:10:56,239 --> 02:10:58,560
yeah and it felt a good case for example

3334
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:00,159
yeah i wanted to jump into example

3335
02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:02,320
mapping a few times myself

3336
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:05,360
being a fan of that of the tool

3337
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:07,199
yeah i think that's what i was leaning

3338
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:08,880
to here

3339
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:11,920
when i see whose control speed sets

3340
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:14,880
that's a very pretty i'm i'm changing

3341
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:16,880
the value of some data

3342
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:18,560
in whenever i see something like that

3343
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:20,480
i'm always thinking

3344
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:23,520
why are you changing the data and what

3345
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,000
value

3346
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:27,119
are you changing it to like

3347
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:28,800
what happens if i set the cruise control

3348
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,159
to zero

3349
02:11:30,159 --> 02:11:31,440
what happens if i take the cruise

3350
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,599
control to like 500

3351
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:35,679
like exploring these different values

3352
02:11:35,679 --> 02:11:38,000
will lead to different outcomes

3353
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,400
so so actually i've driven a couple of

3354
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:42,639
cars with adaptive cruise control

3355
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:45,280
and i've experimented with it so i

3356
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,560
actually tried to

3357
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,119
trying to re-engineer the requirements

3358
02:11:49,119 --> 02:11:50,880
so actually when

3359
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:53,040
a thing i figured out is when you run up

3360
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,880
against a car and you slow down

3361
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:57,040
the minute you put your lights to the

3362
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:58,560
left because

3363
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,960
in most of europe we drive on the right

3364
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:01,760
right so

3365
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:04,800
going left if you want to pass someone

3366
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,400
then it will increase its speed

3367
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,320
automatically

3368
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:10,000
that's actually one thing i figured out

3369
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,760
and i didn't know and i can imagine

3370
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:13,199
people that don't know

3371
02:12:13,199 --> 02:12:16,400
and are driving behind a person

3372
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:17,920
putting their lights to the left and

3373
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:19,679
suddenly the car increases that's a bit

3374
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:21,840
scary

3375
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,560
so these are all the things i tried out

3376
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:25,920
i haven't tried the

3377
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:30,000
emergency brake yet i was too scared

3378
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:33,760
i have one question nikki decide so when

3379
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:34,079
we

3380
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:37,360
do big picture event strumming so from

3381
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:40,639
that uh if we

3382
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:43,679
want to identify bounded context uh

3383
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:45,360
should we do it by you know miss

3384
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:47,679
grouping of events or things like that

3385
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:50,560
or bounded context should be identified

3386
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,800
independently only

3387
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,480
i mean so so basically the question is

3388
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:56,960
that is does big picture

3389
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:01,119
even strumming help help me to identify

3390
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:04,560
bounded context and if yes how

3391
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:07,679
yeah so it can help and

3392
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:11,119
the common example you will see

3393
02:13:11,119 --> 02:13:12,800
could you get that picture from the i'm

3394
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:14,079
gonna get that picture from the meetup

3395
02:13:14,079 --> 02:13:16,960
page very quickly

3396
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:20,560
yeah i have another one from alberto

3397
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:23,040
yeah so in theory you can take an event

3398
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:23,920
storm

3399
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:27,760
and you can organize each section

3400
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:31,119
into bounded context like this in theory

3401
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:32,880
you can do this

3402
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:36,079
but a lot of domains i work in

3403
02:13:36,079 --> 02:13:38,320
life isn't so simple like you have

3404
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:40,480
things involving

3405
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:42,480
like one bounded context can be

3406
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:44,000
happening in different places on the

3407
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,760
event storm

3408
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:49,280
so that's why alberto calls it emergent

3409
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:50,000
right

3410
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,360
just what you're saying nick

3411
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:55,760
it's called emerging bounded context so

3412
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:57,679
it's not a bounded context yet it's like

3413
02:13:57,679 --> 02:13:59,599
uh there's a possibility here

3414
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:03,440
is that what you're what you mean there

3415
02:14:05,119 --> 02:14:08,320
could be could be yeah so it's

3416
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:09,199
definitely

3417
02:14:09,199 --> 02:14:12,079
it's definitely the possibility but what

3418
02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:13,760
i'm saying on this diagram here

3419
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,000
some of these bubbles it might be the

3420
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,159
same bound of context repeated multiple

3421
02:14:18,159 --> 02:14:20,400
times

3422
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:23,760
it might be a bounded context

3423
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:26,880
gets involved here and it gets involved

3424
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:27,760
here as well

3425
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,599
later in the process like towards the

3426
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:32,239
start and towards the end

3427
02:14:32,239 --> 02:14:36,400
and yeah so for me that would be a smell

3428
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:40,079
usually why is that it's like every

3429
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:40,800
single

3430
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:43,760
life cycle right like a user signs up

3431
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:45,119
user does some stuff

3432
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:48,239
a user might close their account yeah

3433
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:48,560
but

3434
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:51,199
if at the start it might be a smell

3435
02:14:51,199 --> 02:14:52,000
because

3436
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,360
the pivotal event are mostly system

3437
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:57,920
boundaries already on a higher level

3438
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:01,040
and going in i might say there there

3439
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:02,560
might be a different purpose on the

3440
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:04,239
right side than there is on the left

3441
02:15:04,239 --> 02:15:06,480
side

3442
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:08,239
of the floor because it's a different

3443
02:15:08,239 --> 02:15:10,400
business phase yeah so

3444
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:12,560
but the thing is business phases and

3445
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:14,159
capabilities

3446
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:16,400
are different things a capability can

3447
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:19,440
support multiple business phases

3448
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:23,280
yeah like a bank account i create a bank

3449
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:23,920
account

3450
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:26,079
i put money in i take money out i put

3451
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:27,840
money i take money out i close my bank

3452
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:28,960
account

3453
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:31,520
like that doesn't all happen in a nice

3454
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:33,760
little bubble in one place

3455
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:35,520
there's other stuff happening between it

3456
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:37,040
like i might create

3457
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:40,000
a mortgage open a bank account put some

3458
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:40,880
money in

3459
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:45,119
start a mortgage close my bank account

3460
02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:46,960
do stuff to the mortgage like these

3461
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:48,960
things don't all happen

3462
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:51,840
in clusters

3463
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:55,760
and it can be a smell but it's also

3464
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:57,840
quite common in my experience what what

3465
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:59,280
happens is

3466
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:01,360
there's that there's that paper from i

3467
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:02,719
always get the name of the paper

3468
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:05,679
but it says when people try and take a

3469
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:06,719
process

3470
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:08,639
and they try and break each process into

3471
02:16:08,639 --> 02:16:10,719
separate phases

3472
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:13,360
but with coupling common elements that

3473
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:14,079
are used in

3474
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:19,840
multiple phases

3475
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:28,320
was it is it the paper by

3476
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,079
i'm just looking for something really

3477
02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:32,319
quick for the david parnes

3478
02:16:32,319 --> 02:16:36,399
paper yeah so here it it

3479
02:16:36,399 --> 02:16:38,639
it depends so this is a nice this is

3480
02:16:38,639 --> 02:16:40,559
always an interesting discussion that

3481
02:16:40,559 --> 02:16:42,719
always keeps

3482
02:16:42,719 --> 02:16:46,719
this is flowing around right so uh about

3483
02:16:46,719 --> 02:16:49,359
the thing to remember about a bounded

3484
02:16:49,359 --> 02:16:51,200
contacts is that it's an implementation

3485
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:53,359
detail it's in a tactical design pattern

3486
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:53,920
so it's

3487
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:57,439
how we design it right

3488
02:16:57,439 --> 02:16:59,280
and a big picture event storming is

3489
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:01,760
about the problem space

3490
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:04,000
so that's why i think alberta calls them

3491
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,920
emergent bounded contexts where you say

3492
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:07,679
well here probably i want to start

3493
02:17:07,679 --> 02:17:09,200
diving in and

3494
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:13,359
look for possible bounded contexts but

3495
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:15,599
that's why all these tools help what you

3496
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:17,599
just did nick that's how i

3497
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:20,240
where i believe in is you need several

3498
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:21,439
tools to

3499
02:17:21,439 --> 02:17:23,200
to especially at the start when your

3500
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:25,359
novel try different things out

3501
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:28,080
eric evans always say a model is not a

3502
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:28,639
model

3503
02:17:28,639 --> 02:17:30,639
at least try three three different

3504
02:17:30,639 --> 02:17:32,000
models and see how

3505
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,120
how it feels how it goes how it uh how

3506
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:37,679
it's working

3507
02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:39,840
yeah so if i go back to the bank account

3508
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,599
if you were to model that process of

3509
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:42,639
creating an account

3510
02:17:42,639 --> 02:17:44,719
putting money in taking money out

3511
02:17:44,719 --> 02:17:46,479
putting money in taking money out

3512
02:17:46,479 --> 02:17:49,679
you would have a creation account

3513
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:52,080
a depositing account a withdrawal sorry

3514
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:53,120
a

3515
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:55,920
creating an account bounded context

3516
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:58,399
depositing money bounded context

3517
02:17:58,399 --> 02:18:01,040
withdrawing money bounded context and a

3518
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:02,880
closing an account bounded context

3519
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:05,439
those are the four phases but each of

3520
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:07,599
those four phases

3521
02:18:07,599 --> 02:18:12,319
relies on the same bits of data

3522
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:15,120
yeah the account balance all of those

3523
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:18,160
things depend on that

3524
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:22,880
yeah so here on the maybe bottom right

3525
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:23,760
side

3526
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:27,200
you see the the the the albertos

3527
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,639
interpretation of

3528
02:18:28,639 --> 02:18:32,000
of bounded contexts and business phases

3529
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:32,960
and

3530
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:34,960
business lines in this block yeah that's

3531
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:36,080
it yeah

3532
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:40,160
yeah exactly so and that represents his

3533
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:53,840
big picture in in a way

3534
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:57,920
yeah yeah so in this one he doesn't have

3535
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:00,880
any context that cross phases

3536
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:07,040
no no

3537
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:09,840
so everything is in within one phase and

3538
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:13,840
it crosses business lines but not phases

3539
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:16,479
yep if you read that partners paper

3540
02:19:16,479 --> 02:19:19,679
parnis argues for the opposite

3541
02:19:19,679 --> 02:19:21,280
as you do want you should look for

3542
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:24,479
things that cross faces

3543
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,240
that happened in several phases he talks

3544
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:30,880
about it as well

3545
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:36,639
great i think uh we're out of time

3546
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:41,120

3547
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:42,639

3548
02:19:42,639 --> 02:19:45,679

nick thank you i hope uh i hope people

3550
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,240
enjoyed today

3551
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:54,160
um if you want to get more knowledge in

3552
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:56,800
uh we are remodeling the virtual ddd

3553
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:57,359
site

3554
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:00,000
there's a learning subject that we're

3555
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,520
that's heavily under construction but

3556
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:03,200
it's already

3557
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:06,080
you can already start using it and we're

3558
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:06,960
trying to

3559
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:10,000
create or curate contact there from

3560
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,880
for instance the dvd crew which most of

3561
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:14,560
the resources come to

3562
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:16,560
and just as a learning platform so if

3563
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:18,960
you want to learn more go to the site

3564
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:21,120
and uh thank you all for coming thank
