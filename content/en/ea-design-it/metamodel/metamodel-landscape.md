## Landscape Viewpoint
IT lanscape, composed by hundred of applications and components is difficult to model. A single and comprehensive model is often too complex to be understood. 

That's why it's important to introduce views and viewpoints.

Using TOGAF terminology, A **view** is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. A **viewpoint** defines the perspective from which a view is taken. Viewpoint a kind of template, and View is an instantiation of a a specific viewpoint

This first version of the tool implement a unique ViewPoint : **Application Landscape**. As explained below, it≈õ equivalent to Archimate **Application Cooperation Viewpoint**.

## Example

A Landscape is a set of [Functional Flow](../metamodel-functional-flow/) that together gives for example a big picture of specific domain.

![landscape](../png/landscape.png)

In this example, Landscape in composed of 3 Functional Flows : <span>**S01**</span>{: .bg-yellow-000 }, **S02** et **S03**

![landscape as set of flows](../png/landscape-flows.png)

## Mapping with Archimate specification

An application landscape is typically an **Application Cooperation Viewpoint**.

<span>Archimate 3.1</span>{: .label .label-blue } **Architecture View** - A representation of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. 

<span>Archimate 3.1</span>{: .label .label-blue } **Architecture Viewpoint** - A specification of the conventions for a particular kind of architecture view. 

<span>Archimate 3.1</span>{: .label .label-blue } The **Application Cooperation Viewpoint** describes the relationships between application components in terms of the information flows between them, or in terms of the services they offer and use. This viewpoint is typically used to create an overview of the application landscape of an organization.

Application Cooperation Viewpoint used the following elements:
 - Application Components
 - Flow Relationship
